	abstract = {Problem: It is well documented that logging is one of the most dangerous occupations and industries in which to work, and trees fellers are at greatest risk of injury. The objective of this study was to determine whether West Virginia ({WV}) logging companies experienced a reduction in injuries after beginning to use feller-bunchers (tree cutting machines, which replace some of the work done with a chainsaw) during harvesting operations. Methods: {WV} workers compensation claims and employment data from 1995 to 2000 were used to calculate injury rates. Injury trends in the rest of the {WV} logging industry, not using feller-bunchers, were also assessed. Results: For 11 companies, the pre-feller-buncher injury claims rate was 19.4 per 100 workers and the post-feller-buncher rate was 5.2 per 100 workers. This was a significant difference, with an adjusted rate ratio of 2.8 (95\% {CI}: 1.8–4.5) of pre to post claims. Struck by injuries also showed significant decline, with the pre-feller-buncher injury rate being 3.8 (95\% {CI}: 1.8–8.2) times as great as post-feller-buncher rate. During the time of the study, the injury rate rose in the rest of the {WV} logging industry. The average cost of a workers compensation claim in the {WV} logging industry during the time of the study was approximately \$10,400. Impact on industry: As mechanization of logging tasks becomes more widespread, the {WV} logging industry as a whole may see substantial injury declines and a reduction in the total cost of injury claims. Struck by injuries, the most common and potentially fatal of logging injury types, appear to be particularly affected. However, logging operations in areas of very steep terrain where it is not possible to use these machines may need to rely on strategies other than feller-bunchers to reduce injuries.},

	abstract = {This is the first textbook on a generally applicable control strategy for turbulence and other complex nonlinear systems. The approach of the book employs powerful methods of machine learning for optimal nonlinear control laws. This machine learning control ({MLC}) is motivated and detailed in Chapters 1 and 2. In Chapter 3, methods of linear control theory are reviewed. In Chapter 4, {MLC} is shown to reproduce known optimal control laws for linear dynamics ({LQR}, {LQG}). In Chapter 5, {MLC} detects and exploits a strongly nonlinear actuation mechanism of a low-dimensional dynamical system when linear control methods are shown to fail. Experimental control demonstrations from a laminar shear-layer to turbulent boundary-layers are reviewed in Chapter 6, followed by general good practices for experiments in Chapter 7. The book concludes with an outlook on the vast future applications of {MLC} in Chapter 8. Matlab codes are provided for easy reproducibility of the presented results. The book includes interviews with leading researchers in turbulence control (S. Bagheri, B. Batten, M. Glauser, D. Williams) and machine learning (M. Schoenauer) for a broader perspective. All chapters have exercises and supplemental videos will be available through {YouTube}.},

	abstract = {As panoramic photography becomes increasingly popular, there is a greater need for high-quality software to automatically create panoramic images. Existing algorithms either produce a rough "stitch" that cannot deal with common artifacts, or require user input. This paper presents methods for dealing with two artifacts that often occur in practice. Our first contribution is a method for dealing with objects that move between different views of a dynamic scene. If such moving objects are left in, they will appear blurry and "ghosted". Treating such regions as nodes in a graph, we use a vertex cover algorithm to selectively remove all but one instance of each object. Our second contribution is a method for continuously adjusting exposure across multiple images in order to eliminate visible shifts in brightness or hue. We compute exposure corrections on a block-by block basis, then smoothly interpolate the parameters using a spline to get spatially continuous exposure adjustment. Our enhancements, combined with previously published techniques for automatic image stitching, result in a high-quality automated stitcher that exhibits far fewer artifacts than existing software.},

In this paper, we study the kinematic bicycle model, which is often used for trajectory planning, and compare its results to a 9 degrees of freedom model. Modeling errors and limitations of the kinematic bicycle model are highlighted.

Real disturbances, however, are mostly stochastic signals which cannot be exactly described nor predicted. The deterministic signals used for the design of control systems are often ‘proxies’ of real signals. These proxies have simple shapes to reduce the design complexity and to allow for easy interpretation of the control system output. The resulting control systems are then optimal only for the chosen proxy signal and the applied criterion. For all other signals the control system is sub-optimal; however, this is not very important in most cases. If the demands on the control performance increase, the controllers must be matched not only to the dynamic behaviour of the processes but also to the disturbances. To this the theory of stochastic signals has much to contribute.},

The {SLAM} community has made astonishing progress over the last 30 years, enabling large-scale real-world applications, and witnessing a steady transition of this technology to industry. We survey the current state of {SLAM}. We start by presenting what is now the de-facto standard formulation for {SLAM}. We then review related work, covering a broad set of topics including robustness and scalability in long-term mapping, metric and semantic representations for mapping, theoretical performance guarantees, active {SLAM} and exploration, and other new frontiers. This paper simultaneously serves as a position paper and tutorial to those who are users of {SLAM}. By looking at the published research with a critical eye, we delineate open challenges and new research issues, that still deserve careful scientific investigation. The paper also contains the authors' take on two questions that often animate discussions during robotics conferences: Do robots need {SLAM}? and Is {SLAM} solved?},

	doi = {10.1109/IROS.2013.6696406},
	abstract = {In this paper, we model the robust loop-closure pose-graph {SLAM} problem as a Bayesian network and show that it can be solved with the Classification Expectation-Maximization ({EM}) algorithm. In particular, we express our robust pose-graph {SLAM} as a Bayesian network where the robot poses and constraints are latent and observed variables. An additional set of latent variables is introduced as weights for the loop-constraints. We show that the weights can be chosen as the Cauchy function, which are iteratively computed from the errors between the predicted robot poses and observed loop-closure constraints in the Expectation step, and used to weigh the cost functions from the pose-graph loop-closure constraints in the Maximization step. As a result, outlier loop-closure constraints are assigned low weights and exert less influences in the pose-graph optimization within the {EM} iterations. To prevent the {EM} algorithm from getting stuck at local minima, we perform the {EM} algorithm multiple times where the loop constraints with very low weights are removed after each {EM} process. This is repeated until there are no more changes to the weights. We show proofs of the conceptual similarity between our {EM} algorithm and the M-Estimator. Specifically, we show that the weight function in our {EM} algorithm is equivalent to the robust residual function in the M-Estimator. We verify our proposed algorithm with experimental results from multiple simulated and real-world datasets, and comparisons with other existing works.},

	abstract = {Aeroelastic systems achieve the best performance when the aerodynamic shape and structural sizing are optimized concurrently, but such an optimization is challenging when high-ﬁdelity aerodynamic and structural models are required. This paper addresses this challenge through several signiﬁcant improvements. Fully coupled Newton–Krylov methods are presented for the solution of aerostructural systems and for the corresponding adjoint systems. The coupled adjoint method presented can compute gradients with respect to thousands of multidisciplinary design variables accurately and eﬃciently. This is enabled by several improvements in the computation of the multidisciplinary terms in the coupled adjoint. The parallel scalability of the methods is demonstrated for a full aircraft conﬁguration using an Euler computational ﬂuid dynamics model with more than 8 × 106 state variables and a detailed structural ﬁnite element model of the wing with more than 1×106 degrees of freedom. The coupled Newton–Krylov methods are shown to improve the convergence rate of both the aerostructural solution and the coupled adjoint derivative computations. Gradient computations of aerodynamic and structural functions with respect to both aerodynamic shape and structural sizing variables are veriﬁed, and scaling is demonstrated to O(103) variables. The accuracy and scalability of the presented methods make it possible to perform aerostructural optimizations of full aircraft conﬁgurations with respect to hundreds of external shape and structural sizing design variables, leading to optimal aeroelastic tailoring.},

First, it is an expository introduction to {MDO} aimed at those who do research on optimization algorithms, since the optimization community has much to contribute to this important class of computational engineering problems. Second, this paper presents to the {MDO} research community a new abstraction for multidisciplinary analysis and design problems as well as new decomposition formulations for these problems. Third, the “individual discipline feasible” ({IDF}) approaches introduced here make use of existing specialized analysis codes, and they introduce significant opportunities for coarse-grained computational parallelism particularly well suited to heterogeneous computing environments.The key distinguishing characteristic of the three fundamental approaches to {MDO} formulation discussed here is the kind of disciplinary feasibility that must be maintained at each optimization iteration. Other formulation issues, such as the sensitivities required, are also considered. This discussion highlights the trade-offs between reuse of existing software, computational requirements, and probability of success.},

	abstract = {Structural optimization using gradient-based methods is a powerful design technique that is well suited for the design of high-performance structures. However, the ever-increasing complexity of ﬁniteelement models and design formulations results in a bottleneck in the computation of the gradients required for the design optimization. Furthermore, in light of current high-performance computing trends, any methods intended to address this bottleneck must efﬁciently utilize parallel computing resources. Therefore, there is a need for solution and gradient evaluation methods that scale well with the number of design variables, constraints, and processors. We address this need by developing an integrated parallel ﬁnite-element analysis tool for gradient-based design optimization that is designed to use specialized parallel solution methods to solve large-scale high-ﬁdelity structural optimization problems with thousands of design variables, millions of state variables, and hundreds of load cases. We describe the most relevant details of the parallel algorithms used within the tool. We present consistent constraint formulations and aggregation techniques for both material failure and buckling constraints. To demonstrate both the solution and functional accuracy, we compare our results to an exact solution of a pressure-loaded cylinder made with either isotropic or orthotropic material. To demonstrate the parallel solution and gradient evaluation performance, we perform a structural analysis and gradient evaluation for a large transport aircraft wing with over 5.44 million unknowns. The results show near-ideal scalability of the structural solution and gradient computation with the number of design variables, constraints, and processors, which makes this framework well suited for large-scale high-ﬁdelity structural design optimization.},

In the first part, we review numerical optimal control solution methods, focussing exclusively on a discrete time setting. We discuss several algorithmic ”building blocks” that can be combined to a multitude of algorithms. We start by discussing the sequential and simultaneous approaches, the first leading to smaller, the second to more structured optimization problems. The two big families of Newton type optimization methods, Sequential Quadratic Programming ({SQP}) and Interior Point ({IP}) methods, are presented, and we discuss how to exploit the optimal control structure in the solution of the linear-quadratic subproblems, where the two major alternatives are “condensing” and band structure exploiting approaches. The second part of the paper discusses how the algorithms can be adapted to the real-time challenge of {NMPC} and {MHE}. We recall an important sensitivity result from parametric optimization, and show that a tangential solution predictor for online data can easily be generated in Newton type algorithms. We point out one important difference between {SQP} and {IP} methods: while both methods are able to generate the tangential predictor for fixed active sets, the {SQP} predictor even works across active set changes. We then classify many proposed real-time optimization approaches from the literature into the developed categories.},

	abstract = {We present an extension of the adjoint method that allows us to compute the second derivatives of seismic data functionals with respect to Earth model parameters. This work is intended to serve as a technical prelude to the implementation of Newton-like optimization schemes and the development of quantitative resolution analyses in time-domain full seismic waveform inversion. The Hessian operator H applied to a model perturbation δm can be expressed in terms of four different wavefields. The forward field u excited by the regular source, the adjoint field u† excited by the adjoint source located at the receiver position, the scattered forward field δu and the scattered adjoint field δu†. The formalism naturally leads to the notion of Hessian kernels, which are the volumetric densities of Hδm. The Hessian kernels appear as the superposition of (1) a first-order influence zone that represents the approximate Hessian, and (2) second-order influence zones that represent second-order scattering. To aid in the development of physical intuition we provide several examples of Hessian kernels for finite-frequency traveltime measurements on both surface and body waves. As expected, second-order scattering is efficient only when at least one of the model perturbations is located within the first Fresnel zone of the Fréchet kernel. Second-order effects from density heterogeneities are generally negligible in transmission tomography, provided that the Earth model is parameterized in terms of density and seismic wave speeds. With a realistic full waveform inversion for European upper-mantle structure, we demonstrate that significant differences can exist between the approximate Hessian and the full Hessian—despite the near-optimality of the tomographic model. These differences are largest for the off-diagonal elements, meaning that the approximate Hessian can lead to erroneous inferences concerning parameter trade-offs. The full Hessian, in contrast, allows us to correctly account for the effect of non-linearity on model resolution.},

They preserve the rapid local convergence of Newton’s method at a signiﬁcantly reduced cost per step by successively approximating the system Jacobian though low-rank updates. We analyze two variants of the recently proposed adjoint Broyden update, which for the ﬁrst time combines the classical least change property with heredity on afﬁne systems. However, the new update does require, the evaluation of so-called adjoint vectors, namely products of the transposed Jacobian with certain dual direction vectors. The resulting quasi-Newton method is linear contravariant in the sense of Deuﬂhard (Newton methods for nonlinear equations. Springer, Heidelberg, 2006) and it is shown here to be locally and q-superlinearly convergent. Our numerical results on a range of test problems demonstrate that the new method usually outperforms Newton’s and Broyden’s method in terms of runtime and iterations count, respectively.},

The result from these methods can be too large, often by orders of magnitude, when the result is the derivative of a long time averaged quantity. This failure is known to be caused by ill-conditioned initial value problems. This paper overcomes this failure by replacing the initial value problem with the well-conditioned “least squares shadowing ({LSS}) problem”. The {LSS} problem is then linearized in our sensitivity analysis algorithm, which computes a derivative that converges to the derivative of the infinitely long time average. We demonstrate our algorithm in several dynamical systems exhibiting both periodic and chaotic oscillations.},

Unlike a forecast model which describes the evolution of meteorological fields forward in time, the adjoint equations describe the evolution of sensitivity (to initial, boundary and parametric conditions) backward in time. Essentially, by utilizing this sensitivity information, many types of problems can be solved more efficiently than in the past, including variational data assimilation, parameter fitting, optimal instability and sensitivity analysis in general. For this reason, the adjoints of various models and their applications have been appearing more and more frequently in meteorological research. This paper is a bibliography in chronological order of published works in meteorology dealing with adjoints which have appeared prior to this issue of Tellus. Also included are meteorological works regarding variational methods (even without adjoints) and Kalman filtering in data assimilation, plus some references outside meteorology. These additional works are included here because the main thrust for adjoint application within meteorology is currently concentrated in the development of next-generation data assimilation systems.},

From the beginning the ordinary explicit expression for linear in the parameters model is expanded into an implicit expression. Then a generic algorithm in terms of least squares error is developed for the model parameter estimation. It has been proved that a nonlinear rational model can be expressed as an implicit linear in the parameters model, therefore, the developed algorithm can be comfortably revised for estimating the parameters of the rational models. The major advancement of the generic algorithm is its conciseness and efficiency in dealing with the parameter estimation problems associated with nonlinear in the parameters models. Further, the algorithm can be used to deal with those regression terms which are subject to noise. The algorithm is reduced to an ordinary least square algorithm in the case of linear or linear in the parameters models. Three simulated examples plus a realistic case study are used to test and illustrate the performance of the algorithm.},

The method depends only on the information embedded in the signals of individual events, and therefore does not need any prior position training or calibration. Three possible distributions of the light sources were evaluated: an exact solid-angle-based distribution, an approximate solid-angle distribution and an extended approximate solid-angle-based distribution which includes internal reflection at side and bottom surfaces. The performance of the general model using these three distributions was studied using Monte Carlo simulated data of a 20 × 20 × 10 mm lutetium oxyorthosilicate (Lu2SiO5 or {LSO}) block read out by 2 Hamamatsu S8550 avalanche photo diode arrays. The approximate solid-angle-based model had the best compromise between resolution and simplicity. This model was also evaluated using experimental data by positioning a narrow 1.2 mm full width at half maximum ({FWHM}) beam of 511 {keV} photons at known positions on the 20 × 20 × 10 mm {LSO} block. An average intrinsic resolution in the X-direction of 1.4 mm {FWHM} was obtained for positions covering the complete block. The intrinsic {DOI} resolution was estimated at 2.6 mm {FWHM}.},

	abstract = {We propose the first fast and certifiable algorithm for the registration of two sets of 3D points in the presence of large amounts of outlier correspondences. Towards this goal, we first reformulate the registration problem using a Truncated Least Squares ({TLS}) cost that makes the estimation insensitive to spurious correspondences. Then, we provide a general graph-theoretic framework to decouple scale, rotation, and translation estimation, which allows solving in cascade for the three transformations. Despite the fact that each subproblem is still non-convex and combinatorial in nature, we show that (i) {TLS} scale and (component-wise) translation estimation can be solved in polynomial time via an adaptive voting scheme, (ii) {TLS} rotation estimation can be relaxed to a semidefinite program ({SDP}) and the relaxation is tight, even in the presence of extreme outlier rates. We name the resulting algorithm {TEASER} (Truncated least squares Estimation And {SEmidefinite} Relaxation). While solving large {SDP} relaxations is typically slow, we develop a second certifiable algorithm, named {TEASER}++, that circumvents the need to solve an {SDP} and runs in milliseconds. For both algorithms, we provide theoretical bounds on the estimation errors, which are the first of their kind for robust registration problems. Moreover, we test their performance on standard benchmarks, object detection datasets, and the 3DMatch scan matching dataset, and show that (i) both algorithms dominate the state of the art (e.g., {RANSAC}, branch-\&-bound, heuristics) and are robust to more than 99\% outliers, (ii) {TEASER}++ can run in milliseconds and it is currently the fastest robust registration algorithm, (iii) {TEASER}++ is so robust it can also solve problems without correspondences (e.g., hypothesizing all-to-all correspondences) where it largely outperforms {ICP}. We release a fast open-source C++ implementation of {TEASER}++.},

	abstract = {One of the challenges in computational modeling is coupling models to solve multidisciplinary problems. Flow-based computational frameworks alleviate part of the challenge through a modular approach, where data flows from component to component. However, existing flow-based frameworks are inefficient when coupled derivatives are needed for optimization. To address this, we develop the modular analysis and unified derivatives ({MAUD}) architecture. {MAUD} formulates the multidisciplinary model as a nonlinear system of equations, which leads to a linear equation that unifies all methods for computing derivatives. This enables flow-based frameworks that use the {MAUD} architecture to provide a common interface for the chain rule, adjoint method, coupled adjoint method, and hybrid methods; {MAUD} automatically uses the appropriate method for the problem. A hierarchical, matrix-free approach enables modern solution techniques such as Newton--Krylov solvers to be used within this monolithic formulation without computational overhead. Two demonstration problems are solved using a Python implementation of {MAUD}: a nanosatellite optimization with more than 2 million unknowns and 25,000 design variables, and an aircraft optimization involving over 6,000 design variables and 23,000 constraints. {MAUD} is now implemented in the open source framework {OpenMDAO}, which has been used to solve aircraft, satellite, wind turbine, and turbofan engine design problems.},

Hence, many Newton-type variants have been proposed which aim at extending Newton-{CG} beyond strongly convex problems. However, the analysis of almost all these non-convex methods commonly relies on the Lipschitz continuity assumptions of the gradient and Hessian. Furthermore, the sub-problems of many of these methods are themselves non-trivial optimization problems. Here, we show that two simple modifications of Newton-{CG} result in an algorithm, called Newton-{MR}, which offers a diverse range of algorithmic and theoretical advantages. Newton-{MR} can be applied, beyond the traditional convex settings, to invex problems. Sub-problems of Newton-{MR} are simple ordinary least squares. Furthermore, by introducing a weaker notion of joint regularity of Hessian and gradient, we establish the global convergence of Newton-{MR} even in the absence of the usual smoothness assumptions. We also obtain Newton-{MR}'s local convergence guarantee that generalizes that of Newton-{CG}. Specifically, unlike the local convergence analysis of Newton-{CG}, which relies on the notion of isolated minimum, our analysis amounts to local convergence to the set of minima.},

Agility here refers to the ease and ﬂexibility to assemble, adjust and reconﬁgure {MDAO} computational systems. This is a necessary feature to comply with the complex and iterative nature of the (aircraft) design process. {KADMOS} has been developed on the notion that a formal speciﬁcation of an {MDAO} system is required before proceeding with integration of the executable workﬂow. A thorough formulation of the system becomes essential when such system is built on the many contributions of large, heterogeneous design teams. {KADMOS} can automate the generation of such formulations through a graph-based methodological approach. The graph syntax and manipulation algorithms form the core content of this paper. First, a simple {MDAO} benchmark problem is used to illustrate {KADMOS}’s working principles. Second, a wing aerostructural design case is discussed to demonstrate {KADMOS}’s capabilities to enable collaborative {MDAO} on large problems of industry-representative complexity. Next to its graph-theoretic foundation, {KADMOS} makes use of two data schemas: one containing the parametric representation of the product being designed and a second to store the achieved formulation of the {MDAO} system. The latter enables the interchangeable use of different process integration and design optimization platforms to automatically integrate the generated {MDAO} system formulation as an executable workﬂow. The proposed approach has been estimated to be capable of halving the time typically required to set up and iteratively reconﬁgure a complex {MDAO} system, while allowing discipline experts and system architects to maintain constant oversight and control of the overall system and its components by means of human-readable dynamic visualizations.},

	abstract = {Multidisciplinary design optimization is a field of research that studies the application of numerical optimization techniques to the design of engineering systems involving multiple disciplines or components. Since the inception of multidisciplinary design optimization, various methods (architectures) have been developed and applied to solve multidisciplinary design-optimization problems. This paper provides a survey of all the architectures that have been presented in the literature so far. All architectures are explained in detail using a unified description that includes optimization problem statements, diagrams, and detailed algorithms. The diagrams show both data and process flow through the multidisciplinary system and computational elements, which facilitate the understanding of the various architectures, and how they relate to each other. A classification of the multidisciplinary design-optimization architectures based on their problem formulations and decomposition strategies is also provided, and the benefits and drawbacks of the architectures are discussed from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. For each architecture, several applications to the solution of engineering-design problems are cited. The result is a comprehensive but straightforward introduction to multidisciplinary design optimization for nonspecialists and a reference detailing all current multidisciplinary design-optimization architectures for specialists.},

Regularization allows us to dispense with the assumption that the active gradients are linearly independent. At each iteration, a linear system with a symmetric quasi-definite ({SQD}) matrix is solved. This matrix is shown to be uniformly bounded and nonsingular. While the linear system may be solved using sparse {LDLT} factorization, we observe that other approaches may be used. In particular, we build on the connection between {SQD} linear systems and unconstrained linear least-squares problems to solve the linear system with sparse {QR} factorization. We establish conditions under which a solution of the original, constrained least-squares problem is recovered. We report computational experience with the sparse {QR} factorization and illustrate the potential advantages of our approach.},

The original {iSAM} algorithm incrementally maintains the square root information matrix by applying matrix factorization updates. We analyze the matrix updates as simple editing operations on the Bayes tree and the conditional densities represented by its cliques. Based on that insight, we present a new method to incrementally change the variable ordering which has a large effect on efficiency. The efficiency and accuracy of the new method is based on fluid relinearization, the concept of selectively relinearizing variables as needed. This allows us to obtain a fully incremental algorithm without any need for periodic batch steps. We analyze the properties of the resulting algorithm in detail, and show on various real and simulated datasets that the {iSAM}2 algorithm compares favorably with other recent mapping algorithms in both quality and efficiency.},

Similar to a clique tree, a Bayes tree encodes a factored probability density, but unlike the clique tree it is directed and maps more naturally to the square root information matrix of the simultaneous localization and mapping ({SLAM}) problem. In this paper, we highlight three insights provided by our new data structure. First, the Bayes tree provides a better understanding of batch matrix factorization in terms of probability densities. Second, we show how the fairly abstract updates to a matrix factorization translate to a simple editing of the Bayes tree and its conditional densities. Third, we apply the Bayes tree to obtain a completely novel algorithm for sparse nonlinear incremental optimization, that combines incremental updates with fluid relinearization of a reduced set of variables for efficiency, combined with fast convergence to the exact solution. We also present a novel strategy for incremental variable reordering to retain sparsity.We evaluate our algorithmon standard datasets in both landmark and pose {SLAM} settings.},

Smoothing approaches have been investigated as a viable alternative to extended Kalman filter ({EKF})-based solutions to the problem. In particular, approaches have been looked at that factorize either the associated information matrix or the measurement Jacobian into square root form. Such techniques have several significant advantages over the {EKF}: they are faster yet exact; they can be used in either batch or incremental mode; are better equipped to deal with non-linear process and measurement models; and yield the entire robot trajectory, at lower cost for a large class of {SLAM} problems. In addition, in an indirect but dramatic way, column ordering heuristics automatically exploit the locality inherent in the geographic nature of the {SLAM} problem. This paper presents the theory underlying these methods, along with an interpretation of factorization in terms of the graphical model associated with the {SLAM} problem. Both simulation results and actual {SLAM} experiments in large-scale environments are presented that underscore the potential of these methods as an alternative to {EKF}-based approaches.},

The control is nonlinear in the estimate of the state of the plant and is given as the weighted integral of the model conditional optimal controls with the a-posteriori probabilities as weights. The control scheme is separated into a bank of model-conditional deterministic control gains, and a corresponding bank of known nonlinear functions of the model conditional, causal, mean-square state-vector estimate. The separation here can be viewed as a decomposition of the control into a bank of model conditional optimal non-adaptive linear controls, one for each admissible value of the unknown parameter, and the bank of a-posteriori model probabilities which incorporate the learning nature of the adaptive control. The computational requirements are reduced by a great extent for the special case when the uncertainity is only in the measurement matrix.
Résumé
Un algorithme de contrôle adaptif pour des systèmes linéaires ayant des paramètres constants inconnus et un critère de performance quadratique a été obtenu. Le contrôle est non linéaire dans l'estimation de l'état de l'installation et il est donné comme intégrale chargée des contrôles optimaux conditionels du modèle avec des probabilités à postériori comme charges. Le système de contrôle est divisé en une batterie de gains de contrôle déterministique conditionel du modèle, et en une batterie correspondante de fonctions non linéaires connues de l'estimation de vecteur d'état moyen carré, causal, conditionel du modèle. Cette division peut être considérée ici comme une décomposition du contrôle en une batterie de contrôles linéaires non adaptifs optimaux conditionels du modèle, une pour chaque valeur admissible du paramètre inconnu, et en une batterie de probabilités du modèle à postériori qui incorpore la nature enseignante du contrôle adatif. Les demandes en calcul sont fortement réduites dans le cas spécial où l'incertitude n'existe que dans la matrice de mesure.
Zusammenfassung
Ein Anpassungskontrollalgorithmus für lineare Systeme mit unbekannten, konstanten Parametern und quadratischem Leistungskriterium ist erhalten wordem. Die Kontrolle in der Schätzung des Zustandes der Anlage ist nicht linear und wird als des Gewichtsintegral der modellbedingten optimalen Kontrollen mit den aus der Beobachtung gewonnenen Wahrscheinlichkeiten als Gewichte gegeben. Der Steuerplan wird in einer Bank von modellbedingten deterministischen Steurerverstärkungen und in einer Bank von bekannten nichtlinearen Funktionen der modellbedingten, kausalen, quadratsummendurchschnittlichen Zustandsvektorscha̋tzung separiert. Die Separierung kann hier als eine Zerlegung der Steuerung in eine Bank modellbedingter, optimaler, nicht anpassungsfähiger linearer Steuerungen angesehen werden, eine für jeden zugelassenen Wert der unbekannten Parameter, und in die Bank von aus Beobachtung gewonnenen Wahrscheinlichkeiten, welche die lernende Natur der anpassungsfähigen Steuerung verkörpern. Die rechenbetonten Erfordernisse werden ganz beträchtlich für den Spezialfall reduziert, wenn die Ungewissheit nur in der Bemessungsmatrix liegt.

Several methods have been proposed to learn dynamics models from data that inform model-based control algorithms. While such learning-based approaches can model locally observed behaviors, they fail to generalize to more complex dynamics and under long time horizons. In this work, we introduce a differentiable physics simulator for rigid body dynamics. Leveraging various techniques for differential equation integration and gradient calculation, we compare different methods for parameter estimation that allow us to infer the simulation parameters that are relevant to estimation and control of physical systems. In the context of trajectory optimization, we introduce a closed-loop model-predictive control algorithm that infers the simulation parameters through experience while achieving cost-minimizing performance.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we show that all processes associated with the move-sense-update cycle of extended Kalman filter ({EKF}) Simultaneous Localization and Mapping ({SLAM}) can be carried out in time linear with the number of map features. We describe Divide and Conquer {SLAM}, which is an {EKF} {SLAM} algorithm in which the computational complexity per step is reduced from O(n 2) to O(n), and the total cost of {SLAM} is reduced from O(n 3) to O(n 2). Unlike many current large-scale {EKF} {SLAM} techniques, this algorithm computes a solution without relying on approximations or simplifications (other than linearizations) to reduce computational complexity. Also, estimates and covariances are available when needed by data association without any further computation. Furthermore, as the method works most of the time in local maps, where angular errors remain small, the effect of linearization errors is limited. The resulting vehicle and map estimates are more precise than those obtained with standard {EKF} {SLAM}. The errors with respect to the true value are smaller, and the computed state covariance is consistent with the real error in the estimation. Both simulated experiments and the Victoria Park dataset are used to provide evidence of the advantages of this algorithm.},

Instead of specifying a discrete sequence of hidden layers, we parameterize the derivative of the hidden state using a neural network. The output of the network is computed using a black-box differential equation solver. These continuous-depth models have constant memory cost, adapt their evaluation strategy to each input, and can explicitly trade numerical precision for speed. We demonstrate these properties in continuous-depth residual networks and continuous-time latent variable models. We also construct continuous normalizing flows, a generative model that can train by maximum likelihood, without partitioning or ordering the data dimensions. For training, we show how to scalably backpropagate through any {ODE} solver, without access to its internal operations. This allows end-to-end training of {ODEs} within larger models.},

A non-stiff Lotka-Volterra model, a discretization of the two dimensional (\$N {\textbackslash}times N\$) Brusselator stiff reaction-diffusion {PDE}, a stiff non-linear air pollution and a non-stiff pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic ({PK}/{PD}) model were used as prototype models for this investigation. Our benchmarks show that on sufficiently small ({\textless}100 parameters) stiff and non-stiff systems of {ODEs}, forward-mode {DSAAD} is more efficient than both reverse-mode {DSAAD} and continuous forward/adjoint sensitivity analysis. The scalability of continuous adjoint methods is shown to result in better efficiency for larger {ODE} systems such as {PDE} discretizations. In addition to testing efficiency, results on test equations demonstrate the applicability of {DSAAD} to differential-algebraic equations, delay differential equations, and hybrid differential equation systems where the event timing and effects are dependent on model parameters. Together, these results show that language-level automatic differentiation is an efficient method for calculating local sensitivities of a wide range of differential equation models.},

For each family, forward, adjoint and tangent linear models are implemented, which enables {FATODE} for direct and adjoint sensitivity analysis. In this paper, we describe the implementation aspects of {FATODE}, code organization and usage aspects.

Julia is designed to be easy and fast. Julia questions notions generally held as "laws of nature" by practitioners of numerical computing: 1. High-level dynamic programs have to be slow. 2. One must prototype in one language and then rewrite in another language for speed or deployment, and 3. There are parts of a system for the programmer, and other parts best left untouched as they are built by the experts. We introduce the Julia programming language and its design --- a dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. Multiple dispatch, a technique from computer science, picks the right algorithm for the right circumstance. Abstraction, what good computation is really about, recognizes what remains the same after differences are stripped away. Abstractions in mathematics are captured as code through another technique from computer science, generic programming. Julia shows that one can have machine performance without sacrificing human convenience.},

An algorithm obtained by combining a least squares estimator with a minimum variance regulator computed from the estimated model is analysed. The main results are two theorems which characterize the closed loop system obtained under the assumption that the parameter estimates converge. The first theorem states that certain covariances of the output and certain cross-covariances of the control variable and the output will vanish under weak assumptions on the system to be controlled. In the second theorem it is assumed that the system to be controlled is a general linear stochastic nth order system. It is shown that if the parameter estimates converge the control law obtained is in fact the minimum variance control law that could be computed if the parameters of the system were known. This is somewhat surprising since the least squares estimate is biased. Some practical implications of the results are discussed. In particular it is shown that the algorithm can be feasibly implemented on a small process computer.},

Smoothing-based estimation methods seek to optimize for the most likely robot state estimate using all measurements up till the current time step.

However, in many cases observed measurements and knowledge of the environment is better modeled as hard constraints derived from real-world physics or dynamics.

The measurement function in most common forms of {SLAM} is linear with respect to robot and features’ positions. Therefore, given an estimate for robot orientation, the conditionally optimal estimate for the rest of state variables can be easily obtained by solving a sparse linear-Gaussian estimation problem. We propose an algorithm to exploit this intrinsic property of {SLAM} by stripping the problem down to its nonlinear core, while maintaining its natural sparsity. Our algorithm can be used together with any Newton-based iterative solver and is applicable to 2D/3D pose-graph and feature-based problems. Our results suggest that iteratively solving the nonlinear core of {SLAM} leads to a fast and reliable convergence as compared to the state-of-the-art back-ends.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05631},
	abstract = {This thesis takes inspiration from quantum physics to investigate mathematical structure that lies at the interface of algebra and statistics. The starting point is a passage from classical probability theory to quantum probability theory. The quantum version of a probability distribution is a density operator, the quantum version of marginalizing is an operation called the partial trace, and the quantum version of a marginal probability distribution is a reduced density operator. Every joint probability distribution on a finite set can be modeled as a rank one density operator. By applying the partial trace, we obtain reduced density operators whose diagonals recover classical marginal probabilities. In general, these reduced densities will have rank higher than one, and their eigenvalues and eigenvectors will contain extra information that encodes subsystem interactions governed by statistics. We decode this information, and show it is akin to conditional probability, and then investigate the extent to which the eigenvectors capture "concepts" inherent in the original joint distribution. The theory is then illustrated with an experiment that exploits these ideas. Turning to a more theoretical application, we also discuss a preliminary framework for modeling entailment and concept hierarchy in natural language, namely, by representing expressions in the language as densities. Finally, initial inspiration for this thesis comes from formal concept analysis, which finds many striking parallels with the linear algebra. The parallels are not coincidental, and a common blueprint is found in category theory. We close with an exposition on free (co)completions and how the free-forgetful adjunctions in which they arise strongly suggest that in certain categorical contexts, the "fixed points" of a morphism with its adjoint encode interesting information.},

Both schedules overcome the essential difficulties of existing schedules in recent literature works where, through introducing a deterministic event-triggering mechanism, the Gaussian property of the innovation process is destroyed which produces a challenging nonlinear filtering problem that cannot be solved unless approximation techniques are adopted. The proposed stochastic event-triggered sensor schedules eliminate such approximations. Under these two schedules, the minimum mean squared error ({MMSE}) estimator and its estimation error covariance matrix at the remote estimator are given in a closed-form. The stability in terms of the expected error covariance and the sample path of the error covariance for both schedules is studied. We also formulate and solve an optimization problem to obtain the minimum communication rate under some estimation quality constraint using the open-loop sensor schedule. A numerical comparison between the closed-loop {MMSE} estimator and a typical approximate {MMSE} estimator with deterministic event-triggered sensor schedule, in a problem setting of target tracking, shows the superiority of the proposed sensor schedule.},

The sensor has computational capability to implement a local Kalman filter. The sensor-to-estimator communications are scheduled intentionally over a finite time horizon to obtain a desirable tradeoff between the state estimation quality and the limited communication resources. Compared with the literature, we adopt a Gaussianity-preserving event-based sensor schedule bypassing the nonlinearity problem met in threshold event-based polices. We derive the closed-form of minimum mean-square error ({MMSE}) estimator and show that, if communication is triggered, the estimator cannot do better than the local Kalman filter, otherwise, the associated error covariance, is simply a sum of the estimation error of the local Kalman filter and the performance loss due to the absence of communication. We further design the scheduler’s parameters by solving a dynamic programming ({DP}) problem. The computational overhead of the {DP} problem is less sensitive to the system dimension compared with that of existing algorithms in the literature.},

The goal is to design an adaptive controller to adequately control the unknown system when its performance is measured by the average cost incurred over a long operating time period. Our main result is the exhibition of a family of adaptive controllers which, when applied to the unknown system, will result in a performance precisely equal to the optimal performance attainable if the system, i.e., the transition probabilities, were known. Hence, the adaptive controllers proposed here are truly optimal, even when operating on an unknown system. The results presented here extend similar results in [1] where we assume to be initially provided with a finite set of possible models, one of which is guaranteed to be the true one. This paper directly addresses those practical situations where a finite set of possible models with such a guarantee is hard to come by.},

Machine learning provides these, developing methods that can automatically detect patterns in data and then use the uncovered patterns to predict future data.

The book is written in an informal, accessible style, complete with pseudo-code for the most important algorithms. All topics are copiously illustrated with color images and worked examples drawn from such application domains as biology, text processing, computer vision, and robotics. Rather than providing a cookbook of different heuristic methods, the book stresses a principled model-based approach, often using the language of graphical models to specify models in a concise and intuitive way. Almost all the models described have been implemented in a {MATLAB} software package―{PMTK} (probabilistic modeling toolkit)―that is freely available online. The book is suitable for upper-level undergraduates with an introductory-level college math background and beginning graduate students.},

	abstract = {An accurate characterization of pose uncertainty is essential for safe autonomous navigation. Early pose uncertainty characterization methods proposed by Smith, Self, and Cheeseman ({SCC}), used coordinate-based first-order methods to propagate uncertainty through non-linear functions such as pose composition (head-to-tail), pose inversion, and relative pose extraction (tail-to-tail). Characterizing uncertainty in the Lie Algebra of the special Euclidean group results in better uncertainty estimates. However, existing approaches assume that individual poses are independent. Since factors in a pose graph induce correlation, this independence assumption is usually not reflected in reality. In addition, prior work has focused primarily on the pose composition operation. This paper develops a framework for modeling the uncertainty of jointly distributed poses and describes how to perform the equivalent of the {SSC} pose operations while characterizing uncertainty in the Lie Algebra. Evaluation on simulated and open-source datasets shows that the proposed methods result in more accurate uncertainty estimates. An accompanying C++ library implementation is also released.

	abstract = {Dissipative Systems Analysis and Control (second edition) presents a fully revised and expanded treatment of dissipative systems theory, constituting a self-contained, advanced introduction for graduate students, researchers and practising engineers. It examines linear and nonlinear systems with examples of both in each chapter; some infinite-dimensional examples are also included. Throughout, emphasis is placed on the use of the dissipative properties of a system for the design of stable feedback control laws. The theory is substantiated by experimental results and by reference to its application in illustrative physical cases (Lagrangian and Hamiltonian systems and passivity-based and adaptive controllers are covered thoroughly). The second edition is substantially reorganized both to accommodate new material and to enhance its pedagogical properties. Some of the changes introduced are: • Complete proofs of the main theorems and lemmas. • The Kalman–Yakubovich–Popov Lemma for non-minimal realizations, singular systems, and discrete-time systems (linear and nonlinear). • Passivity of nonsmooth systems (differential inclusions, variational inequalities, Lagrangian systems with complementarity conditions). • Sections on optimal control and H-infinity theory. • An enlarged bibliography with more than 550 references, and an augmented index with more than 500 entries. • An improved appendix with introductions to viscosity solutions, Riccati equations and some useful matrix algebra. Praise for the first edition: …an extensive exposition of both the mathematics, physics motivation and control applications of passivity and dissipativity… the richness of a very impressive inventory of illustrating examples stands out as a point of excellence… Automatica …an excellent reference for graduate students, engineers and researchers.

Swarm engineering is an emerging discipline that aims at defining systematic and well founded procedures for modeling, designing, realizing, verifying, validating, operating, and maintaining a swarm robotics system.

	abstract = {With the rapid development of society and the economy, an increasing number of human activities have gradually destroyed the marine environment. Marine environment monitoring is a vital problem and has increasingly attracted a great deal of research and development attention. During the past decade, various marine environment monitoring systems have been developed. The traditional marine environment monitoring system using an oceanographic research vessel is expensive and time-consuming and has a low resolution both in time and space. Wireless Sensor Networks ({WSNs}) have recently been considered as potentially promising alternatives for monitoring marine environments since they have a number of advantages such as unmanned operation, easy deployment, real-time monitoring, and relatively low cost. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art technologies in the field of marine environment monitoring using wireless sensor networks. It first describes application areas, a common architecture of {WSN}-based oceanographic monitoring systems, a general architecture of an oceanographic sensor node, sensing parameters and sensors, and wireless communication technologies. Then, it presents a detailed review of some related projects, systems, techniques, approaches and algorithms. It also discusses challenges and opportunities in the research, development, and deployment of wireless sensor networks for marine environment monitoring.},

Since most cyber attacks happen in erratic ways, it is difficult to describe them systematically. In this paper, instead of identifying a specific cyber attack model, we are focused on analyzing the system's response during cyber attacks. Deception attacks (or false data injection attacks), which are performed by tampering with system components or data, are not of particular concern if they can be easily detected by the system's monitoring system. However, intelligent cyber attackers can avoid being detected by the monitoring system by carefully design cyber attacks. Our main objective is to investigate the performance of such stealthy deception attacks from the system's perspective. We investigate three kinds of stealthy deception attacks according to the attacker's ability to compromise the system. Based on the information about the dynamics of the system and existing hypothesis testing algorithms, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions under which the attacker could perform each kind of attack without being detected. In the end, we illustrate the threat of these cyber attacks using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle ({UAV}) navigation example.},

An intelligent attacker can design a sequence of data injection to sensors and actuators that pass the state estimator and statistical fault detector, based on knowledge of the system parameters. To stay undetected, the injected data should increase the state estimation errors while keep the estimation residues small. We employ a coding matrix to change the original sensor outputs to increase the estimation residues under intelligent data injection attacks. This is a low-cost method compared with encryption schemes over all sensor measurements in communication networks. We show the conditions of a feasible coding matrix under the assumption that the attacker does not have knowledge of the exact coding matrix. An algorithm is developed to compute a feasible coding matrix, and, we show that in general, multiple feasible coding matrices exist. To defend against attackers who estimates the coding matrix via sensor and actuator measurements, time-varying coding matrices are designed according to the detection requirements. A heuristic algorithm to decide the time length of updating a coding matrix is then proposed.},

Since rotations are the actual reason why {SLAM} is a difﬁcult problem, in this work we survey techniques for 3D rotation estimation. Rotation estimation has a rich history in three scientiﬁc communities: robotics, computer vision, and control theory. We review relevant contributions across these communities, assess their practical use in the {SLAM} domain, and benchmark their performance on representative {SLAM} problems (Fig. 1). We show that the use of rotation estimation to bootstrap iterative pose graph solvers entails signiﬁcant boost in convergence speed and robustness.},

	abstract = {A new version of the extended Kalman filter ({EKF}) is proposed for nonlinear systems possessing symmetries. Instead of using a linear correction term based on a linear output error, it uses a geometrically adapted correction term based on an invariant output error; in the same way the gain matrix is not updated from of a linear state error, but from an invariant state error. The benefit is that the gain and covariance equations converge to constant values on a much bigger set of trajectories than equilibrium points as is the case for the {EKF}, which should result in a better convergence of the estimation. This filter is applied to the practically relevant problem of estimating the velocity and attitude of a moving rigid body, e.g. an aircraft, from {GPS} velocity, inertial and magnetic measurements. In this context it can be seen as an extension of the ¿multiplicative {EKF}¿ often used for quaternion estimation.},

	abstract = {Current solutions to the simultaneous localization and mapping ({SLAM}) problem approach it as the optimization of a graph of geometric constraints. Scalability is achieved by reducing the size of the graph, usually in two phases. First, some selected nodes in the graph are marginalized and then, the dense and nonrelinearizable result is sparsiﬁed. The sparsiﬁed network has a new set of relinearizable factors and is an approximation to the original dense one. Sparsiﬁcation is typically approached as a Kullback–Liebler divergence ({KLD}) minimization between the dense marginalization result and the new set of factors. For a simple topology of the new factors, such as a tree, there is a closed form optimal solution. However, more populated topologies can achieve a much better approximation because more information can be encoded, although in that case iterative optimization is needed to solve the {KLD} minimization. Iterative optimization methods proposed by the state-of-art sparsiﬁcation require parameter tuning that strongly affects their convergence. In this letter, we propose factor descent and noncyclic factor descent, two simple algorithms for {SLAM} sparsiﬁcation that match the state-of-art methods without any parameters to be tuned. The proposed methods are compared against the state of the art with regard to accuracy and {CPU} time, in both synthetic and real world datasets.},

	abstract = {In the context of graph-based simultaneous localization and mapping, node pruning consists in removing a subset of nodes from the graph, while keeping the graph’s information content as close as possible to the original. One often tackles this problem locally by isolating the Markov blanket sub-graph of a node, marginalizing this node and sparsifying the dense result. It means computing an approximation with a new set of factors. For a given approximation topology, the factors’ mean and covariance that best approximate the original distribution can be obtained through minimization of the Kullback-Liebler divergence. For simple topologies such as Chow-Liu trees, there is a closed form for the optimal solution. However, a tree is oftentimes too sparse to explain some graphs. More complex topologies require nonlinear iterative optimization. In the present paper we propose Factor Descent, a new iterative optimization method to sparsify the dense result of node marginalization, which works by iterating factor by factor. We also provide a thorough comparison of our approach with state-of-the-art methods in real world datasets with regards to the obtained solution and convergence rates.},

The presented work is novel with respect to previously published methods in that it contains: (i) a detailed formulation of the Doppler error and its associated uncertainty; (ii) an observability analysis that gives the minimal conditions to infer a 2D twist from radar readings; and (iii) a numerical analysis for optimal vehicle sensor placement.

	shorttitle = {The Power of Convex Relaxation},
	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the problem of recovering an unknown matrix from a small fraction of its entries. This is known as the matrix completion problem, and comes up in a great number of applications, including the famous Netflix Prize and other similar questions in collaborative filtering. In general, accurate recovery of a matrix from a small number of entries is impossible; but the knowledge that the unknown matrix has low rank radically changes this premise, making the search for solutions meaningful. This paper presents optimality results quantifying the minimum number of entries needed to recover a matrix of rank r exactly by any method whatsoever (the information theoretic limit). More importantly, the paper shows that, under certain incoherence assumptions on the singular vectors of the matrix, recovery is possible by solving a convenient convex program as soon as the number of entries is on the order of the information theoretic limit (up to logarithmic factors). This convex program simply finds, among all matrices consistent with the observed entries, that with minimum nuclear norm. As an example, we show that on the order of nr log(n) samples are needed to recover a random n x n matrix of rank r by any method, and to be sure, nuclear norm minimization succeeds as soon as the number of entries is of the form nr polylog(n).},

	abstract = {Cyber-physical systems ({CPS}) often rely on external communication for supervisory control or sensing. Unfortunately, these communications render the system vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Attacks that alter messages, such as replay attacks that record measurement signals and then play them back to the system, can cause devastating effects. Dynamic Watermarking methods, which inject a private excitation into control inputs to secure resulting measurement signals, have begun addressing the challenges of detecting these attacks, but have been restricted to linear time invariant ({LTI}) systems. Though {LTI} models are sufficient for some applications, other {CPS}, such as autonomous vehicles, require more complex models. This paper develops a linear time-varying ({LTV}) extension to previous Dynamic Watermarking methods by designing a matrix normalization factor to accommodate the temporal changes in the system. Implementable tests are provided with considerations for real-world systems. The proposed method is then shown to be able to detect generalized replay attacks both in theory and in simulation using a {LTV} vehicle model.},

In addition, for {GMM} parameter estimation, when dealing with a large number of multi-dimensional data sets or unbalanced overlapping mixtures, the expectation maximization ({EM}) algorithm shows a slower convergence speed and requires a high number of iterations. In this paper, a new L-{BFGS} optimization method, based on the Riemannian manifold, is used for {GMM} parameter estimation. Based on actual wind power forecast error data, the suitability of the model and the new optimization algorithm was verified in large, multi-dimensional data sets. The new optimization algorithm has fewer iterations than the {EM} algorithm, with an improved convergence speed.},

Separability is an overlooked structure of {SLAM} that distinguishes it from a generic nonlinear least-squares problem. The standard relative-pose and relative-position measurement models in {SLAM} are affine with respect to robot and features' positions. Therefore, given an estimate for robot orientation, the conditionally optimal estimate for the rest of the state variables can be easily computed by solving a sparse linear least-squares problem. We propose an algorithm to exploit this intrinsic property of {SLAM} by stripping the problem down to its nonlinear core, while maintaining its natural sparsity. Our algorithm can be used in conjunction with any Newton-based solver and is applicable to 2-D/3-D pose-graph and feature-based {SLAM}.

The {MLE} is computed via Riemannian trust-region optimization using the Manopt toolbox. Comparisons of the {MLE} with Crame´r-Rao bounds suggest the estimator is asymptotically efﬁcient.},

In this paper we present a formal analysis of the impact of graph structure on the reliability of the maximum likelihood estimator. In particular, we show that the number of spanning trees in the graph is closely related to the D-optimality criterion in experimental design. We also reveal that in a special class of linear-Gaussian estimation problems over graphs, the algebraic connectivity is related to the E-optimality design criterion. Furthermore, we explain how the average node degree of the graph is related to the ratio between the minimum of negative log-likelihood achievable and its value at the ground truth. These novel insights give us a deeper understanding of the {SLAM} problem. Finally we discuss two important applications of our analysis in active measurement selection and graph pruning. The results obtained from simulations and experiments on real data confirm our theoretical findings.},

	shorttitle = {{SE}-Sync},
	abstract = {Many important geometric estimation problems take the form of synchronization over the special Euclidean group: estimate the values of a set of poses given a set of relative measurements between them. This problem is typically formulated as a nonconvex maximum-likelihood estimation that is computationally hard to solve in general. Nevertheless, in this paper we present an algorithm that is able to efficiently recover certifiably globally optimal solutions of the special Euclidean synchronization problem in a non-adversarial noise regime. The crux of our approach is the development of a semidefinite relaxation of the maximum-likelihood estimation whose minimizer provides an exact {MLE} so long as the magnitude of the noise corrupting the available measurements falls below a certain critical threshold; furthermore, whenever exactness obtains, it is possible to verify this fact a posteriori, thereby certifying the optimality of the recovered estimate. We develop a specialized optimization scheme for solving large-scale instances of this relaxation by exploiting its low-rank, geometric, and graph-theoretic structure to reduce it to an equivalent optimization problem on a low-dimensional Riemannian manifold, and design a truncated-Newton trust-region method to solve this reduction efficiently. Finally, we combine this fast optimization approach with a simple rounding procedure to produce our algorithm, {SE}-Sync. Experimental evaluation on a variety of simulated and real-world pose-graph {SLAM} datasets shows that {SE}-Sync is able to recover certifiably globally optimal solutions when the available measurements are corrupted by noise up to an order of magnitude greater than that typically encountered in robotics and computer vision applications, and does so more than an order of magnitude faster than the Gauss-Newton-based approach that forms the basis of current state-of-the-art techniques.},

	abstract = {When monitoring spatial phenomena with wireless sensor networks, selecting the best sensor placements is a fundamental task. Not only should the sensors be informative, but they should also be able to communicate efficiently. In this paper, we present a data-driven approach that addresses the three central aspects of this problem: measuring the predictive quality of a set of sensor locations (regardless of whether sensors were ever placed at these locations), predicting the communication cost involved with these placements, and designing an algorithm with provable quality guarantees that optimizes the {NP}-hard tradeoff. Specifically, we use data from a pilot deployment to build non-parametric probabilistic models called Gaussian Processes ({GPs})both for the spatial phenomena of interest and for the spatial variability of link qualities, which allows us to estimate predictive power and communication cost of unsensed locations. Surprisingly, uncertainty in the representation of link qualities plays an important role in estimating communication costs. Using these models, we present a novel, polynomial-time, data-driven algorithm, {pSPIEL}, which selects Sensor Placements at Informative and cost-Effective Locations. Our approach exploits two important properties of this problem: submodularity, formalizing the intuition that adding a node to a small deployment can help more than adding a node to a large deployment; and locality, under which nodes that are far from each other provide almost independent information. Exploiting these properties, we prove strong approximation guarantees for our {pSPIEL} approach. We also provide extensive experimental validation of this practical approach on several real-world placement problems, and built a complete system implementation on 46 Tmote Sky motes, demonstrating significant advantages over existing methods.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08021},
	abstract = {Over the course of the past decade, a variety of randomized algorithms have been proposed for computing approximate least-squares ({LS}) solutions in large-scale settings. A longstanding practical issue is that, for any given input, the user rarely knows the actual error of an approximate solution (relative to the exact solution). Likewise, it is difficult for the user to know precisely how much computation is needed to achieve the desired error tolerance. Consequently, the user often appeals to worst-case error bounds that tend to offer only qualitative guidance. As a more practical alternative, we propose a bootstrap method to compute a posteriori error estimates for randomized {LS} algorithms. These estimates permit the user to numerically assess the error of a given solution, and to predict how much work is needed to improve a "preliminary" solution. In addition, we provide theoretical consistency results for the method, which are the first such results in this context (to the best of our knowledge). From a practical standpoint, the method also has considerable flexibility, insofar as it can be applied to several popular sketching algorithms, as well as a variety of error metrics. Moreover, the extra step of error estimation does not add much cost to an underlying sketching algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the method with empirical results.},

We present two randomized algorithms that provide accurate relative-error approximations to the optimal value and the solution vector of a least squares approximation problem more rapidly than existing exact algorithms. Both of our algorithms preprocess the data with the Randomized Hadamard transform. One then uniformly randomly samples constraints and solves the smaller problem on those constraints, and the other performs a sparse random projection and solves the smaller problem on those projected coordinates. In both cases, solving the smaller problem provides relative-error approximations, and, if n is sufficiently larger than d, the approximate solution can be computed in O(nd ln d) time.},

State-of-the-art approaches have been demonstrated to be very efficient in medium- and large-sized scenarios; however, their convergence to the maximum likelihood estimate heavily relies on the quality of the initial guess. We show that, in planar scenarios, pose graph optimization has a very peculiar structure. The problem of estimating robot orientations from relative orientation measurements is a quadratic optimization problem (after computing suitable regularization terms); moreover, given robot orientations, the overall optimization problem becomes quadratic. We exploit these observations to design an approximation of the maximum likelihood estimate, which does not require the availability of an initial guess. The approximation, named {LAGO} (Linear Approximation for pose Graph Optimization), can be used as a stand-alone tool or can bootstrap state-of-the-art techniques, reducing the risk of being trapped in local minima. We provide analytical results on existence and sub-optimality of {LAGO}, and we discuss the factors influencing its quality. Experimental results demonstrate that {LAGO} is accurate in common {SLAM} problems. Moreover, it is remarkably faster than state-of-the-art techniques, and is able to solve very large-scale problems in a few seconds.},

We control this distortion by developing a novel geometric inequality, which permits us to propose and analyze a Riemannian counterpart to Nesterov's accelerated gradient method.},

	abstract = {Perception systems for autonomy are most useful if they can operate within limited/predictable computing resources. Existing algorithms in robot navigation—e.g. simultaneous localization and mapping—employ concepts from ﬁltering, ﬁxed-lag, or incremental smoothing to ﬁnd feasible inference solutions. Using factor graphs as a probabilistic modeling language, we emphasize the importance of marginalization operations on the equivalent Bayes (junction) tree. The objective is to elucidate the connection between simple tree-based message passing rules with the aforementioned state estimation approaches, and their frequently overlooked relation to direct marginalization on the Bayes tree. We characterize the inherent marginalization operation as part of the fundamental Chapman-Kolmogorov transit integrals which uniﬁes many state-of-the-art approaches. The belief propagation model is then used to deﬁne ﬁve major tree inference strategies, with regard to computation recycling and resource constrained operation. A series of illustrative examples and results show the versatility of the method.},

Our algorithm integrates gyroscope data and corrects the resulting orientation estimate for integration drift using accelerometer and magnetometer data. This correction is computed, at each time instance, using a single gradient descent step with fixed step length. This fixed step length results in robustness against model errors, e.g. caused by large accelerations or by short-term magnetic field disturbances, which we numerically illustrate using Monte Carlo simulations. Our algorithm estimates a three-dimensional update to the orientation rather than the entire orientation itself. This reduces the computational complexity by approximately 1/3 with respect to the state of the art. It also improves the quality of the resulting estimates, specifically when the orientation corrections are large. We illustrate the efficacy of the algorithm using experimental data.},

This leads to easily accepting incorrect matchings when clutter or vehicle errors increase. We propose a new measurement of the joint compatibility of a set of pairings that successfully rejects spurious matchings. We show experimentally that this restrictive criterion can be used to efficiently search for the best solution to data association. Unlike the nearest neighbor, this method provides a robust solution in complex situations, such as cluttered environments or when revisiting previously mapped regions.},

In addition to learning the governing equations of deterministic systems, which then reduces to {SINDy} (sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics), it is possible to identify the drift and diffusion terms of stochastic differential equations from data. Moreover, we apply {gEDMD} to derive coarse-grained models of high-dimensional systems, and also to determine efficient model predictive control strategies.

However, for many interesting problems in robotics, state variables live on a differentiable manifold. The most common example are robot orientations that are elements of the Lie group {SO}(3). This causes problems for {AD} algorithms that only consider differentiation at the scalar level. Jacobians produced by scalar {AD} are correct, but scalar-focused methods are unable to apply simplifications based on the structure of the specific manifold. In this paper we extend the theory of {AD} to encompass handling of differentiable manifolds and provide a C++ library that exploits strong typing and expression templates for fast, easy-to-use Jacobian evaluation. This method has a number of benefits over scalar {AD}. First, it allows the exploitation of algebraic simplifications that make Jacobian evaluations more efficient than their scalar counterparts. Second, strong typing reduces the likelihood of programming errors arising from misinterpretation that are possible when using simple arrays of scalars. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to consider the structure of differentiable manifolds directly in {AD}.},

	abstract = {This paper considers the analysis of continuous time gradient-based optimization algorithms through the lens of nonlinear contraction theory. It demonstrates that in the case of a time-invariant objective, most elementary results on gradient descent based on convexity can be replaced by much more general results based on contraction. In particular, gradient descent converges to a unique equilibrium if its dynamics are contracting in any metric, with convexity of the cost corresponding to the special case of contraction in the identity metric. More broadly, contraction analysis provides new insights for the case of geodesically-convex optimization, wherein non-convex problems in Euclidean space can be transformed to convex ones posed over a Riemannian manifold. In this case, natural gradient descent converges to a unique equilibrium if it is contracting in any metric, with geodesic convexity of the cost corresponding to contraction in the natural metric. New results using semi-contraction provide additional insights into the topology of the set of optimizers in the case when multiple optima exist. Furthermore, they show how semi-contraction may be combined with specific additional information to reach broad conclusions about a dynamical system. The contraction perspective also easily extends to time-varying optimization settings and allows one to recursively build large optimization structures out of simpler elements. Extensions to natural primal-dual optimization and game-theoretic contexts further illustrate the potential reach of these new perspectives.},

	abstract = {Current state of the art solutions of the {SLAM} problem are based on efficient sparse optimization techniques and represent the problem as probabilistic constraint graphs. For example in pose graphs the nodes represent poses and the edges between them express spatial information (e.g. obtained from odometry) and information on loop closures. The task of constructing the graph is delegated to a front-end that has access to the available sensor information. The optimizer, the so called back-end of the system, relies heavily on the topological correctness of the graph structure and is not robust against misplaced constraint edges. Especially edges representing false positive loop closures will lead to the divergence of current solvers. We propose a novel formulation that allows the back-end to change parts of the topological structure of the graph during the optimization process. The back-end can thereby discard loop closures and converge towards correct solutions even in the presence of false positive loop closures. This largely increases the overall robustness of the {SLAM} system and closes a gap between the sensor-driven front-end and the back-end optimizers. We demonstrate the approach and present results both on large scale synthetic and real-world datasets.},

	abstract = {Exploration of unknown environments is embedded and essential in many robotics applications. Traditional algorithms, that decide where to explore by computing the expected information gain of an incomplete map from future sensor measurements, are limited to very powerful computational platforms. In this paper, we describe a novel approach for computing this expected information gain efﬁciently, as principally derived via mutual information. The key idea behind the proposed approach is a continuous occupancy map framework and the recursive structure it reveals. This structure makes it possible to compute the expected information gain of sensor measurements across an entire map much faster than computing each measurements’ expected gain independently. Speciﬁcally, for an occupancy map composed of {\textbar}M {\textbar} cells and a range sensor that emits {\textbar}Θ{\textbar} measurement beams, the algorithm (titled {FCMI}) computes the information gain corresponding to measurements made at each cell in O({\textbar}Θ{\textbar}{\textbar}M {\textbar}) steps. To the best of our knowledge, this complexity bound is better than all existing methods for computing information gain. In our experiments, we observe that this novel, continuous approach is two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art {FSMI} algorithm.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, Non-Linear Least-Squares embodies the foundation of many Robotics and Computer Vision systems. The research community deeply investigated this topic in the last years, and this resulted in the development of several open-source solvers to approach constantly increasing classes of problems. In this work, we propose a unified methodology to design and develop efficient Least-Squares Optimization algorithms, focusing on the structures and patterns of each specific domain. Furthermore, we present a novel open-source optimization system, that addresses transparently problems with a different structure and designed to be easy to extend. The system is written in modern C++ and can run efficiently on embedded systems. Source code: https://srrg.gitlab.io/srrg2-solver.html. We validated our approach by conducting comparative experiments on several problems using standard datasets. The results show that our system achieves state-of-the-art performances in all tested scenarios.},

Consequently the approach to the limit of the discrete-time filter to obtain its continuous-time equivalent no longer depends on Kalman's non-rigorous argument for dividing the covariance of a white noise sequence by the sampling interval Δt. Such an exact equivalence is essential for comparing the accuray of discrete-time computations with results obtained by numerically integrating the continuous-time filter equations.

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the problem of continuous-time nonlinear filtering of stochastic processes evolving on connected Riemannian manifolds without boundary. The main contribution of this paper is to derive the feedback particle filter ({FPF}) algorithm for this problem. In its general form, the {FPF} is shown to provide an intrinsic description of the filter that automatically satisfies the geometric constraints of the manifold. The particle dynamics are encapsulated in a Stratonovich stochastic differential equation that retains the feedback structure of the original (Euclidean) {FPF}. The implementation of the filter requires a solution of a Poisson equation on the manifold, and a numerical algorithm is described for this purpose. For the special case when the manifold is a matrix Lie group, explicit formulae for the filter are derived, using the matrix coordinates. Filters for two example problems are presented: the attitude estimation problem on {SO}(3) and the robot localization problem in {SE}(3). Comparisons are also provided between the {FPF} and popular algorithms for attitude estimation, namely the multiplicative extended Kalman filter ({EKF}), the invariant {EKF}, the unscented quaternion estimator, the invariant ensemble Kalman filter, and the bootstrap particle filter. Numerical simulations are presented to illustrate these comparisons.},

A survival of the fittest strategy that selects the points and keyframes of the reconstruction leads to excellent robustness and generates a compact and trackable map that only grows if the scene content changes, allowing lifelong operation.

Unfortunately, many faults can harm the development or the use of these products. Destructive mechanisms transform faults into errors and finally failures altering the delivered service. For critical systems, the consequences of these failures can be catastrophic, but for most non-critical systems, failures are nowadays unacceptable. Hence, it is necessary to take dependability attributes into account, along the product lifecycle. This book aims at providing a general overview of the dependability of computing systems: impairments and protective means. Issues, concepts and techniques are considered from a system point of view, and are illustrated by both hardware and software technologies. An important pedagogical effort has been made: the explanations are illustrated by 370 figures, 80 examples, and 97 exercises with complete answers.

However, few approaches to this problem scale up to handle the very large number of landmarks present in real environments. Kalman ﬁlter-based algorithms, for example, require time quadratic in the number of landmarks to incorporate each sensor observation. This paper presents {FastSLAM}, an algorithm that recursively estimates the full posterior distribution over robot pose and landmark locations, yet scales logarithmically with the number of landmarks in the map. This algorithm is based on an exact factorization of the posterior into a product of conditional landmark distributions and a distribution over robot paths. The algorithm has been run successfully on as many as 50,000 landmarks, environments far beyond the reach of previous approaches. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages and limitations of the {FastSLAM} algorithm on both simulated and realworld data.},

Due to the trust region constraint, nonconvex models can be used in trust region subproblems, and trust region algorithms can be applied to nonconvex and ill-conditioned problems. Normally it is easier to establish the global convergence of a trust region algorithm than that of its line search counterpart. In the paper, we review recent results on trust region methods for unconstrained optimization, constrained optimization, nonlinear equations and nonlinear least squares, nonsmooth optimization and optimization without derivatives. Results on trust region subproblems and regularization methods are also discussed.},

For example, the capability to explore without any prior knowledge on environment it explores and without any human interference. The unique feature in {SLAM} is that the process of mapping and localization is done concurrently and recursively.

	abstract = {A wide range of system models in modern robotics and avionics applications admit natural symmetries. Such systems are termed equivariant and the structure provided by the symmetry is a powerful tool in the design of observers. Significant progress has been made in the last ten years in the design of filters and observers for attitude and pose estimation, tracking of homographies, and velocity aided attitude estimation, by exploiting their inherent Lie-group state-space structure. However, little work has been done for systems on homogeneous spaces, that is systems on manifolds on which a Lie-group acts rather than systems on the Lie-group itself. Recent research in robotic vision has discovered symmetries and equivariant structure on homogeneous spaces for a host of problems including the key problems of visual odometry and visual simultaneous localisation and mapping. These discoveries motivate a deeper look at the structure of equivariant systems on homogeneous spaces. This paper provides a comprehensive development of the foundation theory required to undertake observer and filter design for such systems.},

	abstract = {We propose a general and practical framework to design certifiable algorithms for robust geometric perception in the presence of a large amount of outliers. We investigate the use of a truncated least squares ({TLS}) cost function, which is known to be robust to outliers, but leads to hard, nonconvex, and nonsmooth optimization problems. Our first contribution is to show that -for a broad class of geometric perception problems- {TLS} estimation can be reformulated as an optimization over the ring of polynomials and Lasserre's hierarchy of convex moment relaxations is empirically tight at the minimum relaxation order (i.e., certifiably obtains the global minimum of the nonconvex {TLS} problem). Our second contribution is to exploit the structural sparsity of the objective and constraint polynomials and leverage basis reduction to significantly reduce the size of the semidefinite program ({SDP}) resulting from the moment relaxation, without compromising its tightness. Our third contribution is to develop scalable dual optimality certifiers from the lens of sums-of-squares ({SOS}) relaxation, that can compute the suboptimality gap and possibly certify global optimality of any candidate solution (e.g., returned by fast heuristics such as {RANSAC} or graduated non-convexity). Our dual certifiers leverage Douglas-Rachford Splitting to solve a convex feasibility {SDP}. Numerical experiments across different perception problems, including high-integrity satellite pose estimation, demonstrate the tightness of our relaxations, the correctness of the certification, and the scalability of the proposed dual certifiers to large problems, beyond the reach of current {SDP} solvers.},

	abstract = {A new shape-from-focus method is described which is based on a new concept, named focused image surface ({FIS}). {FIS} of an object is defined as the surface formed by the set of points at which the object points are focused by a camera lens. According to paraxial-geometric optics, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the shape of an object and the shape of its {FIS}. Therefore, the problem of shape recovery can be posed as the problem of determining the shape of the {FIS}. From the shape of {FIS} the shape of the object is easily obtained. In this paper the shape of the {FIS} is determined by searching for a shape which maximizes a focus measure. In contrast to previous literature where the focus measure is computed over the planar image detector of the camera, here the focus measure is computed over the {FIS}. This results in more accurate shape recovery than the traditional methods. Also, using {FIS}, a more accurate focused image can be reconstructed from a sequence of images than is possible with traditional methods. The new method has been implemented on an actual camera system, and the results of shape recovery and focused image reconstruction are presented.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

Thus, the blur amount can be obtained from the ratio. A layered depth map is then extracted by propagating the blur amount at edge locations to the entire image.

Existing computational methods to capture {RGB} and depth either purposefully modify the optics (coded aperture, light-ﬁeld imaging), or employ active {RGB}-D cameras. Since these methods are less practical for users with normal cameras, we present an algorithm to capture all-in-focus {RGB}-D video of dynamic scenes with an unmodiﬁed commodity video camera. Our algorithm turns the often unwanted defocus blur into a valuable signal. The input to our method is a video in which the focus plane is continuously moving back and forth during capture, and thus defocus blur is provoked and strongly visible. This can be achieved by manually turning the focus ring of the lens during recording. The core algorithmic ingredient is a new video-based depth-from-defocus algorithm that computes space-time-coherent depth maps, deblurred all-in-focus video, and the focus distance for each frame. We extensively evaluate our approach, and show that it enables compelling video post-processing effects, such as different types of refocusing.},

Existing depth estimation methods commonly use an active light source to detect the depth of an object. However, sunlight interferes with their depth measurements and decreases their accuracy outdoors. The proposed method does not need any active light source because depth information is obtained in the image domain, not in the object domain. The depth of field imaging by a retroreflector indicates the depth position of the object image, immediately. We believe that the proposed method can be applied to depth measurement systems such as {LIDAR} and time of flight cameras. An experiment is performed, whose results are compared with theoretical calculations, which confirms the feasibility of the proposed method.},

If the image is of a person, we use a person segmentation network to separate the person and their accessories from the background. If available, we also use dense dual-pixel auto-focus hardware, effectively a 2-sample light field with an approximately 1 millimeter baseline, to compute a dense depth map. These two signals are combined and used to render a defocused image. Our system can process a 5.4 megapixel image in 4 seconds on a mobile phone, is fully automatic, and is robust enough to be used by non-experts. The modular nature of our system allows it to degrade naturally in the absence of a dual-pixel sensor or a human subject.},

	abstract = {Deep learning techniques have enabled rapid progress in monocular depth estimation, but their quality is limited by the ill-posed nature of the problem and the scarcity of high quality datasets. We estimate depth from a single camera by leveraging the dual-pixel auto-focus hardware that is increasingly common on modern camera sensors. Classic stereo algorithms and prior learning-based depth estimation techniques under-perform when applied on this dual-pixel data, the former due to too-strong assumptions about {RGB} image matching, and the latter due to not leveraging the understanding of optics of dual-pixel image formation. To allow learning based methods to work well on dual-pixel imagery, we identify an inherent ambiguity in the depth estimated from dual-pixel cues, and develop an approach to estimate depth up to this ambiguity. Using our approach, existing monocular depth estimation techniques can be effectively applied to dual-pixel data, and much smaller models can be constructed that still infer high quality depth. To demonstrate this, we capture a large dataset of in-the-wild 5-viewpoint {RGB} images paired with corresponding dual-pixel data, and show how view supervision with this data can be used to learn depth up to the unknown ambiguities. On our new task, our model is 30\% more accurate than any prior work on learning-based monocular or stereoscopic depth estimation.},

In a variety of user studies and quantitative tasks, we evaluate how well these cues inform shape reconstruction (relative to each other) in terms of both shape quality and shape recognition.

	abstract = {We consider the problem of localizing a manned, semiautonomous, or autonomous vehicle in the environment using information coming from the vehicle's sensors, a problem known as navigation or simultaneous localization and mapping ({SLAM}) depending on the context. To infer knowledge from sensors' measurements, while drawing on a priori knowledge about the vehicle's dynamics, modern approaches solve an optimization problem to compute the most likely trajectory given all past observations, an approach known as smoothing. Improving smoothing solvers is an active field of research in the {SLAM} community. Most work is focused on reducing computation load by inverting the involved linear system while preserving its sparsity. This article raises an issue that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been addressed yet: standard smoothing solvers require explicitly using the inverse of sensor noise covariance matrices. This means the parameters that reflect the noise magnitude must be sufficiently large for the smoother to properly function. When matrices are close to singular, which is the case when using high-precision modern inertial measurement units ({IMUs}), numerical issues necessarily arise, especially with 32-bit implementation demanded by most industrial aerospace applications. We discuss these issues and propose a solution that builds upon the Kalman filter to improve smoothing algorithms. We then leverage the results to devise a localization algorithm based on the fusion of {IMU} and vision sensors. Successful real experiments using an actual car equipped with a tactical grade high-performance {IMU} and a {LiDAR} illustrate the relevance of the approach to the field of autonomous vehicles.},

	abstract = {The most common way to deal with the uncertainty present in noisy sensorial perception and action is to model the problem with a probabilistic framework. Maximum likelihood estimation is a well-known estimation method used in many robotic and computer vision applications. Under Gaussian assumption, the maximum likelihood estimation converts to a nonlinear least squares problem. Efficient solutions to nonlinear least squares exist and they are based on iteratively solving sparse linear systems until convergence. In general, the existing solutions provide only an estimation of the mean state vector, the resulting covariance being computationally too expensive to recover. Nevertheless, in many simultaneous localization and mapping ({SLAM}) applications, knowing only the mean vector is not enough. Data association, obtaining reduced state representations, active decisions and next best view are only a few of the applications that require fast state covariance recovery. Furthermore, computer vision and robotic applications are in general performed online. In this case, the state is updated and recomputed every step and its size is continuously growing, therefore, the estimation process may become highly computationally demanding.This paper introduces a general framework for incremental maximum likelihood estimation called {SLAM}++, which fully benefits from the incremental nature of the online applications, and provides efficient estimation of both the mean and the covariance of the estimate. Based on that, we propose a strategy for maintaining a sparse and scalable state representation for large scale mapping, which uses information theory measures to integrate only informative and non-redundant contributions to the state representation. {SLAM}++ differs from existing implementations by performing all the matrix operations by blocks. This led to extremely fast matrix manipulation and arithmetic operations used in nonlinear least squares. Even though this paper tests {SLAM}++ efficiency on {SLAM} problems, its applicability remains general.},

However, for many applications recovering only the mean vector is not enough. Data association, active decisions, next best view, are only few of the applications that require fast state covariance recovery. The problem is not simple since, in general, the covariance is obtained by inverting the system matrix and the result is dense. The main contribution of this paper is a novel algorithm for fast incremental covariance update, complemented by a highly efficient implementation of the covariance recovery. This combination yields to two orders of magnitude reduction in computation time, compared to the other state of the art solutions. The proposed algorithm is applicable to any {NLS} solver implementation, and does not depend on incremental strategies described in our previous papers, which are not a subject of this paper.},

The contributions beyond our previous work are an improved algorithm for recovering the marginal covariances and a more thorough treatment of data association now including the joint compatibility branch and bound ({JCBB}) algorithm.

The goal is to create accurate and precise three-dimensional planetary surface-structure estimates by filtering sequences of stereo images taken from an autonomous landing vehicle. We describe a sliding window filter ({SWF}) approach based on delayed state marginalization. The {SWF} can run in constant time, yet still achieve experimental results close to those of the bundle adjustment solution. This technique can scale from the offline batch least-squares solution to fast online incremental solutions. For instance, if the window encompasses all time, the solution is equivalent to full bundle adjustment; if only one time step is maintained, the solution matches the extended Kalman filter; if poses and landmarks are slowly marginalized out over time such that the state vector ceases to grow, then the filter becomes constant time, like visual odometry. Within the constant time regime, the sliding window approach demonstrates convergence properties that are close to those of the full batch solution and strictly superior to visual odometry. Experiments with real data show that ground structure estimates follow the expected convergence pattern that is predicted by theory. These experiments indicate the effectiveness of filtering long-range stereo for {EDL}. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Recent years have witnessed enormous progress in {AI}-related fields such as computer vision, machine learning, and autonomous vehicles. As with any rapidly growing field, it becomes increasingly difficult to stay up-to-date or enter the field as a beginner. While several survey papers on particular sub-problems have appeared, no comprehensive survey on problems, datasets, and methods in computer vision for autonomous vehicles has been published. This book attempts to narrow this gap by providing a survey on the state-of-the-art datasets and techniques. Our survey includes both the historically most relevant literature as well as the current state of the art on several specific topics, including recognition, reconstruction, motion estimation, tracking, scene understanding, and end-to-end learning for autonomous driving. Towards this goal, we analyze the performance of the state of the art on several challenging benchmarking datasets, including {KITTI}, {MOT}, and Cityscapes. Besides, we discuss open problems and current research challenges. To ease accessibility and accommodate missing references, we also provide a website that allows navigating topics as well as methods and provides additional information.},

In computer vision, the oneparameter family of images obtained from the Laplacian-of-a-Gaussian-filtered version of the image, parameterized by the width of the Gaussian, has proven to be a useful data structure for the extraction of feature data. In particular,the zero crossingsof these so-called scalespace data are associated with edges, and were proposed by Marr and others as the basis of a representation of the image data. The question arises as to whether the representationis complete and stable. We survey some of the results and studies related to these questions, and survey several papers that attempt reconstructions based on this or related representations. We then formulate a new method for the reconstructionfrom zero crossings in scale space, based on minimizing equation error, and present results showing that the reconstruction is possible, but can be unstable. We further show that the method applies when gradient data along the zero crossings are included in the representation, and demonstrate empirically that the reconstruction is then stable.},

The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a a substantial range of afﬁne distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and ﬁnally performing veriﬁcation through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.},

	abstract = {Maximum likelihood ({ML}) and restricted maximum likelihood ({REML}) are nowadays very popular in geophysics, geodesy and many other fields. There is also a growing number of investigations into how to calculate covariance parameters by {ML}/{REML} accurately and fast, and assure the convergence of the iteration steps in derivative-based approaches. The latter condition is not satisfied in many solutions, as it requires composed procedures or takes an unacceptable amount of time. The article implements efficient Fisher scoring ({FS}) to covariance parameter estimation in least-squares collocation ({LSC}). {FS} is optimized through Levenberg–Marquardt ({LM}) optimization, which provides stability in convergence when estimating two covariance parameters necessary for {LSC}. The motivation for this work was a very large number of non-optimized {FS} in the literature, as well as a deficiency of its scientific and engineering applications. The example work adds some usefulness to maximum likelihood estimation ({ML}) and {FS} and shows a new application—an alternative approach to {LSC}—a parametrization with no empirical covariance estimation. The results of {LM} damping applied to {FS} ({FSLM}) require some additional research related with optimal {LM} parameter. However, the method appears to be a milestone in relation to non-optimized {FS}, in terms of convergence. The {FS} with {LM} provides a reliable convergence, whose speed can be adjusted by manipulating the {LM} parameter.},

	abstract = {Semidefinite Programming ({SDP}) and Sums-of-Squares ({SOS}) relaxations have led to certifiably optimal non-minimal solvers for several robotics and computer vision problems. However, most non-minimal solvers rely on least-squares formulations, and, as a result, are brittle against outliers. While a standard approach to regain robustness against outliers is to use robust cost functions, the latter typically introduce other non-convexities, preventing the use of existing non-minimal solvers. In this paper, we enable the simultaneous use of non-minimal solvers and robust estimation by providing a general-purpose approach for robust global estimation, which can be applied to any problem where a non-minimal solver is available for the outlier-free case. To this end, we leverage the Black-Rangarajan duality between robust estimation and outlier processes (which has been traditionally applied to early vision problems), and show that graduated non-convexity ({GNC}) can be used in conjunction with non-minimal solvers to compute robust solutions, without requiring an initial guess. Although {GNC}'s global optimality cannot be guaranteed, we demonstrate the empirical robustness of the resulting robust non-minimal solvers in applications, including point cloud and mesh registration, pose graph optimization, and image-based object pose estimation (also called shape alignment). Our solvers are robust to 70-80\% of outliers, outperform {RANSAC}, are more accurate than specialized local solvers, and faster than specialized global solvers. We also propose the first certifiably optimal non-minimal solver for shape alignment using {SOS} relaxation.},

However, their extension to dynamic processes has been elusive so far since standard machine learning tools give rise unscalable algorithms. In this work we propose a systematic and explicit procedure to address this problem by pairing {GP} regression with Kalman Filtering. In particular, under the speciﬁc timespace separability assumption of the kernel which models process and periodic sampling on a (possibly non-uniform) space-grid, we show how to build a ﬁnite dimensional discretetime state-space exact representation for the modeled process. The major ﬁnding is that the state at instant k of the associated Kalman Filter represents a sufﬁcient statistic to compute the minimum variance prediction of the process at instant k over any arbitrary ﬁnite subset of the space. The proposed strategy is then compared with the standard non-parametric estimation and truncated non-parametric estimation strategies both in terms of estimation performance and computation complexity.},

Deep neural networks have provided a new way to perform these tasks, and the choice of rotation representation is an important part of network design. In this work, we present a novel symmetric matrix representation of the 3D rotation group, {SO}(3), with two important properties that make it particularly suitable for learned models: (1) it satisﬁes a smoothness property that improves convergence and generalization when regressing large rotation targets, and (2) it encodes a symmetric Bingham belief over the space of unit quaternions, permitting the training of uncertainty-aware models. We empirically validate the beneﬁts of our formulation by training deep neural rotation regressors on two data modalities. First, we use synthetic point-cloud data to show that our representation leads to superior predictive accuracy over existing representations for arbitrary rotation targets. Second, we use image data collected onboard ground and aerial vehicles to demonstrate that our representation is amenable to an effective out-of-distribution ({OOD}) rejection technique that signiﬁcantly improves the robustness of rotation estimates to unseen environmental effects and corrupted input images, without requiring the use of an explicit likelihood loss, stochastic sampling, or an auxiliary classiﬁer. This capability is key for safety-critical applications where detecting novel inputs can prevent catastrophic failure of learned models.},

	abstract = {We present the three main mathematical constructs used to represent the attitude of a rigid body in threedimensional space. These are (1) the rotation matrix, (2) a triple of Euler angles, and (3) the unit quaternion. To these we add a fourth, the rotation vector, which has many of the beneﬁts of both Euler angles and quaternions, but neither the singularities of the former, nor the quadratic constraint of the latter. There are several other subsidiary representations, such as Cayley-Klein parameters and the axis-angle representation, whose relations to the three main representations are also described. Our exposition is catered to those who seek a thorough and uniﬁed reference on the whole subject; detailed derivations of some results are not presented.},

	abstract = {In neural networks, it is often desirable to work with various representations of the same space. For example, 3D rotations can be represented with quaternions or Euler angles. In this paper, we advance a deﬁnition of a continuous representation, which can be helpful for training deep neural networks. We relate this to topological concepts such as homeomorphism and embedding. We then investigate what are continuous and discontinuous representations for 2D, 3D, and n-dimensional rotations. We demonstrate that for 3D rotations, all representations are discontinuous in the real Euclidean spaces of four or fewer dimensions. Thus, widely used representations such as quaternions and Euler angles are discontinuous and difﬁcult for neural networks to learn. We show that the 3D rotations have continuous representations in 5D and 6D, which are more suitable for learning. We also present continuous representations for the general case of the n dimensional rotation group {SO}(n). While our main focus is on rotations, we also show that our constructions apply to other groups such as the orthogonal group and similarity transforms. We ﬁnally present empirical results, which show that our continuous rotation representations outperform discontinuous ones for several practical problems in graphics and vision, including a simple autoencoder sanity test, a rotation estimator for 3D point clouds, and an inverse kinematics solver for 3D human poses.},

In the presence of loop closures, {VO} can be used as a building block for a complete {SLAM} algorithm to reduce motion drift. Challenges that still remain are to develop and demonstrate large-scale and long-term implementations, such as driving autonomous cars for hundreds of miles. Such systems have recently been demonstrated using Lidar and Radar sensors [86]. However, for {VO} to be used in such systems, technical issues regarding robustness and, especially, long-term stability have to be resolved. Eventually, {VO} has the potential to replace Lidar-based systems for egomotion estimation, which are currently leading the state of the art in accuracy, robustness, and reliability. {VO} offers a cheaper and mechanically easier-to-manufacture solution for egomotion estimation, while, additionally, being fully passive. Furthermore, the ongoing miniaturization of digital cameras offers the possibility to develop smaller and smaller robotic systems capable of ego-motion estimation.},

In this paper, we propose {LS}-Net, a neural nonlinear least squares optimization algorithm which learns to effectively optimize these cost functions even in the presence of adversities. Unlike traditional approaches, the proposed solver requires no hand-crafted regularizers or priors as these are implicitly learned from the data. We apply our method to the problem of motion stereo ie. jointly estimating the motion and scene geometry from pairs of images of a monocular sequence. We show that our learned optimizer is able to efficiently and effectively solve this challenging optimization problem.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12536},
	abstract = {The Wahba problem, also known as rotation search, seeks to find the best rotation to align two sets of vector observations given putative correspondences, and is a fundamental routine in many computer vision and robotics applications. This work proposes the first polynomial-time certifiably optimal approach for solving the Wahba problem when a large number of vector observations are outliers. Our first contribution is to formulate the Wahba problem using a Truncated Least Squares ({TLS}) cost that is insensitive to a large fraction of spurious correspondences. The second contribution is to rewrite the problem using unit quaternions and show that the {TLS} cost can be framed as a Quadratically-Constrained Quadratic Program ({QCQP}). Since the resulting optimization is still highly non-convex and hard to solve globally, our third contribution is to develop a convex Semidefinite Programming ({SDP}) relaxation. We show that while a naive relaxation performs poorly in general, our relaxation is tight even in the presence of large noise and outliers. We validate the proposed algorithm, named {QUASAR} ({QUAternion}-based Semidefinite {relAxation} for Robust alignment), in both synthetic and real datasets showing that the algorithm outperforms {RANSAC}, robust local optimization techniques, global outlier-removal procedures, and Branch-and-Bound methods. {QUASAR} is able to compute certifiably optimal solutions (i.e. the relaxation is exact) even in the case when 95\% of the correspondences are outliers.},

The main contribution of the paper is to provide a remedy for the landmark initialisation problem that occurs due to the absence of range information, in a computationally efficient manner. Each landmark is initialised in the form of multiple hypotheses distributed along the direction of the bearing measurement. Using subsequent measurements, the validity of the hypotheses is evaluated based on the sequential probability ratio test ({SPRT}). Consequently, the best approximation to the landmark location is maintained. This approach enables an extended Kalman filler ({EKF}) to be used for bearing-only {SLAM} providing a computational efficient solution. Simulation and experimental results, from using a camera as the bearing-only sensor mounted on a Pioneer robot are included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.},

However, significant time and effort is frequently required to tune various Kalman filter model parameters, e.g. process noise covariance, pre-whitening filter models for non-white noise, etc. Conventional optimization techniques for tuning can get stuck in poor local minima and can be expensive to implement with real sensor data. To address these issues, a new "black box" Bayesian optimization strategy is developed for automatically tuning Kalman filters. In this approach, performance is characterized by one of two stochastic objective functions: normalized estimation error squared ({NEES}) when ground truth state models are available, or the normalized innovation error squared ({NIS}) when only sensor data is available. By intelligently sampling the parameter space to both learn and exploit a nonparametric Gaussian process surrogate function for the {NEES}/{NIS} costs, Bayesian optimization can efficiently identify multiple local minima and provide uncertainty quantification on its results.},

Perhaps the most frequently encountered estimation problem is the estimation of the mean of a signal in noise. In many parameter estimation problems the situation is more complicated because direct access to the data necessary to estimate the parameters is impossible, or some of the data are missing. Such difficulties arise when an outcome is a result of an accumulation of simpler outcomes, or when outcomes are clumped together, for example, in a binning or histogram operation. There may also be data dropouts or clustering in such a way that the number of underlying data points is unknown (censoring and/or truncation). The {EM} (expectation-maximization) algorithm is ideally suited to problems of this sort, in that it produces maximum-likelihood ({ML}) estimates of parameters when there is a many-to-one mapping from an underlying distribution to the distribution governing the observation. The {EM} algorithm is presented at a level suitable for signal processing practitioners who have had some exposure to estimation theory.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08333},
	abstract = {We present a Gaussian Variational Inference ({GVI}) technique that can be applied to large-scale nonlinear batch state estimation problems. The main contribution is to show how to fit both the mean and (inverse) covariance of a Gaussian to the posterior efficiently, by exploiting factorization of the joint likelihood of the state and data, as is common in practical problems. This is different than Maximum A Posteriori ({MAP}) estimation, which seeks the point estimate for the state that maximizes the posterior (i.e., the mode). The proposed Exactly Sparse Gaussian Variational Inference ({ESGVI}) technique stores the inverse covariance matrix, which is typically very sparse (e.g., block-tridiagonal for classic state estimation). We show that the only blocks of the (dense) covariance matrix that are required during the calculations correspond to the non-zero blocks of the inverse covariance matrix, and further show how to calculate these blocks efficiently in the general {GVI} problem. {ESGVI} operates iteratively, and while we can use analytical derivatives at each iteration, Gaussian cubature can be substituted, thereby producing an efficient derivative-free batch formulation. {ESGVI} simplifies to precisely the Rauch-Tung-Striebel ({RTS}) smoother in the batch linear estimation case, but goes beyond the 'extended' {RTS} smoother in the nonlinear case since it finds the best-fit Gaussian (mean and covariance), not the {MAP} point estimate. We demonstrate the technique on controlled simulation problems and a batch nonlinear Simultaneous Localization and Mapping ({SLAM}) problem with an experimental dataset.},

	abstract = {High dimensional error covariance matrices and their inverses are used to weight the contribution of observation and background information in data assimilation procedures. As observation error covariance matrices are often obtained by sampling methods, estimates are often degenerate or ill-conditioned, making it impossible to invert an observation error covariance matrix without the use of techniques to reduce its condition number. In this paper, we present new theory for two existing methods that can be used to ‘recondition’ any covariance matrix: ridge regression and the minimum eigenvalue method. We compare these methods with multiplicative variance inflation, which cannot alter the condition number of a matrix, but is often used to account for neglected correlation information. We investigate the impact of reconditioning on variances and correlations of a general covariance matrix in both a theoretical and practical setting. Improved theoretical understanding provides guidance to users regarding method selection, and choice of target condition number. The new theory shows that, for the same target condition number, both methods increase variances compared to the original matrix, with larger increases for ridge regression than the minimum eigenvalue method. We prove that the ridge regression method strictly decreases the absolute value of off-diagonal correlations. Theoretical comparison of the impact of reconditioning and multiplicative variance inflation on the data assimilation objective function shows that variance inflation alters information across all scales uniformly, whereas reconditioning has a larger effect on scales corresponding to smaller eigenvalues. We then consider two examples: a general correlation function, and an observation error covariance matrix arising from interchannel correlations. The minimum eigenvalue method results in smaller overall changes to the correlation matrix than ridge regression but can increase off-diagonal correlations. Data assimilation experiments reveal that reconditioning corrects spurious noise in the analysis but underestimates the true signal compared to multiplicative variance inflation.},

	abstract = {This paper presents {ORB}-{SLAM}3, the first system able to perform visual, visual-inertial and multi-map {SLAM} with monocular, stereo and {RGB}-D cameras, using pin-hole and fisheye lens models. The first main novelty is a feature-based tightly-integrated visual-inertial {SLAM} system that fully relies on Maximum-a-Posteriori ({MAP}) estimation, even during the {IMU} initialization phase. The result is a system that operates robustly in real-time, in small and large, indoor and outdoor environments, and is 2 to 5 times more accurate than previous approaches. The second main novelty is a multiple map system that relies on a new place recognition method with improved recall. Thanks to it, {ORB}-{SLAM}3 is able to survive to long periods of poor visual information: when it gets lost, it starts a new map that will be seamlessly merged with previous maps when revisiting mapped areas. Compared with visual odometry systems that only use information from the last few seconds, {ORB}-{SLAM}3 is the first system able to reuse in all the algorithm stages all previous information. This allows to include in bundle adjustment co-visible keyframes, that provide high parallax observations boosting accuracy, even if they are widely separated in time or if they come from a previous mapping session. Our experiments show that, in all sensor configurations, {ORB}-{SLAM}3 is as robust as the best systems available in the literature, and significantly more accurate. Notably, our stereo-inertial {SLAM} achieves an average accuracy of 3.6 cm on the {EuRoC} drone and 9 mm under quick hand-held motions in the room of {TUM}-{VI} dataset, a setting representative of {AR}/{VR} scenarios. For the benefit of the community we make public the source code.},

We also show how Gaussian process models can be integrated into different versions of Bayes filters, namely particle filters and extended and unscented Kalman filters. The resulting {GP}-{BayesFilters} can have several advantages over standard (parametric) filters. Most importantly, {GP}-{BayesFilters} do not require an accurate, parametric model of the system. Given enough training data, they enable improved tracking accuracy compared to parametric models, and they degrade gracefully with increased model uncertainty. These advantages stem from the fact that {GPs} consider both the noise in the system and the uncertainty in the model. If an approximate parametric model is available, it can be incorporated into the {GP}, resulting in further performance improvements. In experiments, we show different properties of {GP}-{BayesFilters} using data collected with an autonomous micro-blimp as well as synthetic data.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a solution to the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping ({SLAM}) problem in the stochastic map framework based on the concept of the relative map. The idea consists in introducing a map state, which only contains relative quantities among the features invariant under shift and rotation. The estimation of this relative state is carried out through an Extended Kalman Filter. The shift and rotation invariance of the state allows us to significantly reduce the computational burden. In particular, the computational requirement is independent of the number of features. Furthermore, since the estimation process is local, it is not affected by the linearization introduced by the {EKF}. The cases of point features and corner features are considered. Furthermore, in the case of corners, it is considered a realistic case of an indoor environment containing structures consisting of several corners. Finally, since a relative map contains dependent elements, the information coming from all the constraints which express the elements dependency, is exploited. For this, an approximated solution with low computational requirement is proposed. Its limitation arises at the loop closure since it cannot exploit the information in this case. This is discussed in depth for the case of point features. Experimental results carried out on a real platform in our laboratory and by using the Victoria park dataset show the performance of the approach.},

	abstract = {Weighted total least squares ({WTLS}) has been widely used as a standard method to optimally adjust an errors-in-variables ({EIV}) model containing random errors both in the observation vector and in the coefﬁcient matrix. An earlier work provided a simple and ﬂexible formulation for {WTLS} based on the standard least-squares ({SLS}) theory. The formulation allows one to directly apply the available {SLS} theory to the {EIV} models. Among such applications, this contribution formulates the {WTLS} problem subject to weighted or hard linear(ized) equality constraints on unknown parameters. The constraints are to be properly incorporated into the system of equations in an {EIV} model of which a general structure for the (singular) covariance matrix {QA} of the coefﬁcient matrix is used. The formulation can easily take into consideration any number of weighted linear and nonlinear constraints. Hard constraints turn out to be a special case of the general formulation of the weighted constraints. Because the formulation is based on the {SLS} theory, the method automatically approximates the covariance matrix of the estimates from which the precision of the constrained estimates can be obtained. Three numerical examples with different scenarios are used to demonstrate the efﬁcacy of the proposed algorithm for geodetic applications. {DOI}: 10.1061/({ASCE}){SU}.1943-5428.0000239. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICCAIS.2012.6466637},
	abstract = {Nowadays, global positioning system ({GPS}) has been used widely in land vehicles to provide positioning services. However, information from this stand-alone device may be interrupted under some circumstances such as: urban environment, under the tunnels, etc. In addition, low-rate sample time typically 1Hz is another drawback of {GPS}. Therefore, {GPS} receiver can be augmented with the inertial navigation system ({INS}) to provide faster positioning information. By fusing {GPS} and {INS} data, the errors are bounded and accuracy increases considerably even when using low-cost {INS} and {GPS}. This paper presents a method of {INS}/{GPS} integration where a loosely coupled model is formulated and an extended Kalman filter is then applied to estimate information about position, velocity, and acceleration. Experiment results show that the processing time is reduced significantly but the estimated errors are acceptable (less than 1 meters) when applying the proposed integration method under the good signal of {GPS}. The performance evaluation is also implemented on several road trajectories in urban city that the 3 meters precision could be reached. In addition, accurate positioning and navigation results are still available from 9 to 14 seconds of {GPS} outages with the position errors spread from 3 to 10 meters ({RMS}).},

	title = {A Neural Network and Kalman Filter Hybrid Approach for {GPS}/{INS} Integration},
	abstract = {It is well known that Kalman filtering is an optimal real-time data fusion method for {GPS}/{INS} integration. However, it has some limitations in terms of stability, adaptability and observability. A Kalman filter can perform optimally only when its dynamic model is correctly defined and the noise statistics for the measurement and process are completely known. It is found that estimated Kalman filter states could be influenced by several factors, including vehicle dynamic variations, filter tuning results, and environment changes, etc., which are difficult to model. Neural networks can map input-output relationships without apriori knowledge about them; hence a proper designed neural network is capable of learning and extracting these complex relationships with enough training. This paper presents a {GPS}/{INS} integrated system that combines Kalman filtering and neural network algorithms to improve navigation solutions during {GPS} outages. An Extended Kalman filter estimates {INS} measurement errors, plus position, velocity and attitude errors etc. Kalman filter states, and gives precise navigation solutions while {GPS} signals are available. At the same time, a multi-layer neural network is trained to map the vehicle dynamics with corresponding Kalman filter states, at the same rate of measurement update. After the output of the neural network meets a similarity threshold, it can be used to correct {INS} measurements when no {GPS} measurements are available. Selecting suitable inputs and outputs of the neural network is critical for this hybrid method. Detailed analysis unveils that some Kalman filter states are highly correlated with vehicle dynamic variations. The filter states that heavily impact system navigation solutions are selected as the neural network outputs. The principle of this hybrid method and the neural network design are presented. Field test data are processed to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {The application of Global Navigation Satellite System ({GNSS}) technology has meant that marine navigators have greater access to a more consistent and accurate positioning capability than ever before. However, {GNSS} may not be able to meet all emerging navigation performance requirements for maritime applications with respect to service robustness, accuracy, integrity and availability. In particular, applications in port areas (for example automated docking) and in constricted waterways, have very stringent performance requirements. Even when an integrated inertial navigation system ({INS})/{GNSS} device is used there may still be performance gaps. {GNSS} signals are easily blocked or interfered with, and sometimes the satellite geometry may not be good enough for high accuracy and high reliability applications. Furthermore, the {INS} accuracy degrades rapidly during {GNSS} outages. This paper investigates the use of a portable ground-based positioning system, known as ‘Locata’, which was integrated with an {INS}, to provide accurate navigation in a marine environment without reliance on {GNSS} signals. An ‘on-the-fly’ Locata resolution algorithm that takes advantage of geometry change via an extended Kalman filter is proposed in this paper. Single-differenced Locata carrier phase measurements are utilized to achieve accurate and reliable solutions. A ‘loosely coupled’ decentralized Locata/{INS} integration architecture based on the Kalman filter is used for data processing. In order to evaluate the system performance, a field trial was conducted on Sydney Harbour. A Locata network consisting of eight Locata transmitters was set up near the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The experiment demonstrated that the Locata on-the-fly ({OTF}) algorithm is effective and can improve the system accuracy in comparison with the conventional ‘known point initialization’ ({KPI}) method. After the {OTF} and {KPI} comparison, the {OTF} Locata/{INS} integration is then assessed further and its performance improvement on both stand-alone {OTF} Locata and {INS} is shown. The Locata/{INS} integration can achieve centimetre-level accuracy for position solutions, and centimetre-per-second accuracy for velocity determination.},

	abstract = {A data gap of {GNSS} and {INS} may occur when data are collected by a vehicle. To obtain the pose information when this data gap appears, we use a combined auto regressive ({AR}) model for the forecasting of {INS} data so that the Strap-down Inertial Navigation System can still work. A forward process is initially implemented to forecast {INS} data using an {AR} model, and then inverse prediction is performed. Finally, the raw {INS} data are determined using forward and inverse results with different weights. The measurement data are applied to this method and the commercial software Inertial Explorer 8.60 ({IE}). The experimental result shows that the errors from the filtered results of the {IE} for loosely coupled and tightly coupled approaches reach the meter level after the data of the {GNSS} and {INS} are retrieved, and the error is at the meter level for conventional loosely coupled approach. Conversely, the maximum error from the proposed method is at the decimeter level. The smoother results have also been affected for the loosely coupled and tightly coupled approach of the {IE} before this data gap of {GNSS} and {INS} appears. However, a centimeter-level result can still be obtained via piecewise smoothing for the proposed method. The data gaps of 5 s and 10 s for {GNSS} and {INS} are simulated. These experiments show that the maximum errors of the smoother results are 0.4374 m and 4.0443 m for the proposed algorithm and these errors are better than the results for the loosely coupled and tightly coupled approach of the {IE} and the conventional loosely coupled approach.},

To fill this gap, this paper evaluates both loosely and tightly-coupled integrations using both {EKF} and {FGO} via the challenging dataset collected in the urban canyon. The detailed analysis of the results for the advantages of the {FGO} is also given in this paper by degenerating the {FGO}-based estimator to an {EKF} like estimator.

The integration of {GPS} with {INS} can be implemented using a Kalman filter in such modes as loosely, tightly and ultra-tightlycoupled. In all these integration modes the {INS} error states, together with any navigation state (position, velocity, attitude) and other unknown parameters of interest, are estimated using {GPS} measurements. In a high performance system it is expected that all these unknown states will be precisely estimated. Although it has been noted that both the quality of the {GPS} measurements and the trajectory and/or manoeuvre characteristics of the problem will have impacts on system performance, a systematic sensitivity analysis is still lacking.

This paper presents a real-time sliding-window estimator that tightly integrates differential {GPS} and an inertial measurement unit to achieve reliable high-precision navigation performance in {GPS}-challenged urban environments using low-cost single-frequency {GPS} receivers. Moreover, this paper proposes a novel method to utilize the phase measurements, without resolving the integer ambiguity vector. Experimental results demonstrate real-time position estimation performance at the decimeter level. Furthermore, the novel use of phase measurements improves the robustness of the estimator to pseudorange multipath error.},

This paper proposes a Contemplative Realtime ({CRT}) framework for tightly coupled Differential {GPS} aided inertial navigation. This method guarantees low latency for real-time application and meanwhile enhances the accuracy and reliability of navigation. To realize these improvements, a Bayesian optimization based smoothing is combined with conventional filtering in an efficient way. For demonstration purpose, this {CRT} framework is implemented on an automotive vehicle with differential pseudorange and {IMU} measurements. The implementation result shows that compared to standard {EKF} method, the proposed approach could provide accurate vehicle navigation with robustness.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new approach for high-rate information fusion in modern inertial navigation systems, that have a variety of sensors operating at different frequencies. Optimal information fusion corresponds to calculating the maximum a posteriori estimate over the joint probability distribution function (pdf) of all states, a computationally-expensive process in the general case. Our approach consists of two key components, which yields a flexible, high-rate, near-optimal inertial navigation system. First, the joint pdf is represented using a graphical model, the factor graph, that fully exploits the system sparsity and provides a plug and play capability that easily accommodates the addition and removal of measurement sources. Second, an efficient incremental inference algorithm over the factor graph is applied, whose performance approaches the solution that would be obtained by a computationally-expensive batch optimization at a fraction of the computational cost. To further aid highrate performance, we introduce an equivalent {IMU} factor based on a recently developed technique for {IMU} pre-integration, drastically reducing the number of states that must be added to the system. The proposed approach is experimentally validated using real {IMU} and imagery data that was recorded by a ground vehicle, and a statistical performance study is conducted in a simulated aerial scenario. A comparison to conventional fixed-lag smoothing demonstrates that our method provides a considerably improved trade-off between computational complexity and performance.},

We propose a solution based on the recently introduced Unscented Kalman Filter on Manifolds ({UKF}-M) for onboard navigation to estimate the robot’s location, attitude and velocity, using a precise round and rotating Earth navigation model. Our algorithm has the merit of seamlessly handling nonlinearity of attitude, and is far simpler to implement than the extended Kalman ﬁlter ({EKF}), which is widely used in the navigation industry. The unscented transform notably spares the user the computation of Jacobians and lends itself well to fast prototyping in the context of multi-sensor data fusion. Besides, we provide the community with feedback about implementation, and execution time is shown to be compatible with real-time. Realistic extensive Monte-Carlo simulations prove uncertainty is estimated with accuracy by the ﬁlter, and illustrate its convergence ability. Real experiments in the context of a 900m deep dive near Marseille (France) illustrate the relevance of the method.},

	abstract = {The {SLAM} problem is known to have a special property that when robot orientation is known, estimating the history of robot poses and feature locations can be posed as a standard linear least squares problem. In this work, we develop a {SLAM} framework that uses relative feature-to-feature measurements to exploit this structural property of {SLAM}. Relative feature measurements are used to pose a linear estimation problem for pose-to-pose orientation constraints. This is followed by solving an iterative non-linear on-manifold optimization problem to compute the maximum likelihood estimate for robot orientation given relative rotation constraints. Once the robot orientation is computed, we solve a linear problem for robot position and map estimation. Our approach reduces the computational burden of non-linear optimization by posing a smaller optimization problem as compared to standard graph-based methods for featurebased {SLAM}. Further, empirical results show our method avoids catastrophic failures that arise in existing methods due to using odometery as an initial guess for non-linear optimization, while its accuracy degrades gracefully as sensor noise is increased. We demonstrate our method through extensive simulations and comparisons with an existing state-of-the-art solver.},

However, radio-based positioning suffers from multipath signals generated by different types of objects in the physical environment. Multipath can be turned into a benefit, by building up a radio map (comprising the number of objects, object type, and object state) and using this map to exploit all available signal paths for positioning. We propose a new method for cooperative vehicle positioning and mapping of the radio environment, comprising a multiple-model probability hypothesis density filter and a map fusion routine, which is able to consider different types of objects and different fields of views.

Among its special features, the book: 1) Develops rigorously and comprehensively the theory of convex sets and functions, in the classical tradition of Fenchel and Rockafellar 2) Provides a geometric, highly visual treatment of convex and nonconvex optimization problems, including existence of solutions, optimality conditions, Lagrange multipliers, and duality 3) Includes an insightful and comprehensive presentation of minimax theory and zero sum games, and its connection with duality 4) Describes dual optimization, the associated computational methods, including the novel incremental subgradient methods, and applications in linear, quadratic, and integer programming 5) Contains many examples, illustrations, and exercises with complete solutions (about 200 pages) posted on the internet.{\textbackslash}{nFrom} the preface:{\textbackslash}{nThis} book focuses on the theory of convex sets and functions, and its connections with a number of topics that span a broad range from continuous to discrete optimization. These topics include Lagrange multiplier theory, Lagrangian and conjugate/Fenchel duality, minimax theory, and nondifferentiable optimization.{\textbackslash}{nThe} book evolved from a set of lecture notes for a graduate course at M.I.T. It is widely recognized that, aside from being an eminently useful subject in engineering, operations research, and economics, convexity is an excellent vehicle for assimilating some of the basic concepts of real analysis within an intuitive geometrical setting. Unfortunately, the subject's coverage in academic curricula is scant and incidental. We believe that at least part of the reason is the shortage of textbooks that are suitable for classroom instruction, particularly for nonmathematics majors. We have therefore tried to make convex analysis accessible to a broader audience by emphasizing its geometrical character, while maintaining mathematical rigor. We have included as many insightful illustrations as possible, and we have used geometric visualization as a principal tool for maintaining the students' interest in mathematical proofs.{\textbackslash}{nOur} treatment of convexity theory is quite comprehensive, with all major aspects of the subject receiving substantial treatment. The mathematical prerequisites are a course in linear algebra and a course in real analysis in finite dimensional spaces (which is the exclusive setting of the book). A summary of this material, without proofs, is provided in Section 1.1. The coverage of the theory has been significantly extended in the exercises, which represent a major component of the book. Detailed solutions of all the exercises (nearly 200 pages) are internet-posted in the book's www page{\textbackslash}{nSome} of the exercises may be attempted by the reader without looking at the solutions, while others are challenging but may be solved by the advanced reader with the assistance of hints. Still other exercises represent substantial theoretical results, and in some cases include new and unpublished research. Readers and instructors should decide for themselves how to make best use of the internet-posted solutions.{\textbackslash}{nAn} important part of our approach has been to maintain a close link between the theoretical treatment of convexity and its application to optimization.; Issue: 0; Includes bibliographical references (p. 517-527) and index},

Our method is based upon a sparse semidefinite relaxation that we prove provides globally-optimal {PGO} solutions under moderate measurement noise (matching the guarantees enjoyed by state-of-the-art centralized methods), but is amenable to distributed optimization using the low-rank Riemannian Staircase framework. To implement the Riemannian Staircase in the distributed setting, we develop Riemannian block coordinate descent ({RBCD}), a novel method for (locally) minimizing a function over a product of Riemannian manifolds. We also propose the first distributed solution verification and saddle escape methods to certify the global optimality of critical points recovered via {RBCD}, and to descend from suboptimal critical points (if necessary). All components of our approach are inherently decentralized: they require only local communication, provide privacy protection, and are easily parallelizable. Extensive evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method correctly recovers globally optimal solutions under moderate noise, and outperforms alternative distributed techniques in terms of solution precision and convergence speed.},

	abstract = {A fast pose-graph relaxation technique is presented for enhancing the consistency of three-dimensional (3D) maps created by registering large planar surface patches. The surface patches are extracted from point clouds sampled from a 3D range sensor. The plane-based registration method offers an alternative to the state-of-the-art algorithms and provides advantages in terms of robustness, speed, and storage. One of its features is that it results in an accurate determination of rotation, although a lack of predominant surfaces in certain directions may result in translational uncertainty in those directions. Hence, a loop-closing and relaxation problem is formulated that gains significant speed by relaxing only the translational errors and utilizes the full-translation covariance determined during pairwise registration. This leads to a fast 3D simultaneous localization and mapping suited for online operations. The approach is tested in two disaster scenarios that were mapped at the {NIST} 2008 Response Robot Evaluation Exercise in Disaster City, Texas. The two data sets from a collapsed car park and a flooding disaster consist of 26 and 70 3D scans, respectively. The results of these experiments show that our approach can generate 3D maps without motion estimates by odometry and that it outperforms iterative closest point–based mapping with respect to speed and robustness. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {We study the notion of compressed sensing ({CS}) as put forward by Donoho, Candes, Tao and others. The notion proposes a signal or image, unknown but supposed to be compressible by a known transform, (e.g. wavelet or Fourier), can be subjected to fewer measurements than the nominal number of data points, and yet be accurately reconstructed. The samples are nonadaptive and measure ‘random’ linear combinations of the transform coefficients. Approximate reconstruction is obtained by solving for the transform coefficients consistent with measured data and having the smallest possible ℓ1 norm. We present initial ‘proof-of-concept’ examples in the favorable case where the vast majority of the transform coefficients are zero. We continue with a series of numerical experiments, for the setting of ℓp-sparsity, in which the object has all coefficients nonzero, but the coefficients obey an ℓp bound, for some p∈(0,1]. The reconstruction errors obey the inequalities paralleling the theory, seemingly with well-behaved constants. We report that several workable families of ‘random’ linear combinations all behave equivalently, including random spherical, random signs, partial Fourier and partial Hadamard. We next consider how these ideas can be used to model problems in spectroscopy and image processing, and in synthetic examples see that the reconstructions from {CS} are often visually “noisy”. To suppress this noise we post-process using translation-invariant denoising, and find the visual appearance considerably improved. We also consider a multiscale deployment of compressed sensing, in which various scales are segregated and {CS} applied separately to each; this gives much better quality reconstructions than a literal deployment of the {CS} methodology. These results show that, when appropriately deployed in a favorable setting, the {CS} framework is able to save significantly over traditional sampling, and there are many useful extensions of the basic idea.},

And then we reconstruct the low-rank covariance matrix by iteratively reweighted nuclear norm optimization that imposes the nonconvex penalty. Finally, we exploit the search-free {DoA} estimation method to perform the parameter estimation. Numerical simulations are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Moreover, results indicate that the proposed method has more accurate {DoA} estimation in the nonuniform noise and off-grid cases compared with the state-of-the-art {DoA} estimation algorithm.},

For these methods to work reliably, estimated matrices must not only be invertible but also well-conditioned. The current paper introduces a novel prior to ensure a well-conditioned maximum a posteriori ({MAP}) covariance estimate. The prior shrinks the sample covariance estimator towards a stable target and leads to a {MAP} estimator that is consistent and asymptotically efficient. Thus, the {MAP} estimator gracefully transitions towards the sample covariance matrix as the number of samples grows relative to the number of covariates. The utility of the {MAP} estimator is demonstrated in two standard applications–discriminant analysis and {EM} clustering–in challenging sampling regimes.},

Its solution is of central importance in covariance estimation, particularly in the recent high-dimensional data environment where enforcing the positive-definiteness constraint could be computationally expensive. We provide a survey of the progress made in modeling covariance matrices from two relatively complementary perspectives: (1) generalized linear models ({GLM}) or parsimony and use of covariates in low dimensions, and (2) regularization or sparsity for high-dimensional data. An emerging, unifying and powerful trend in both perspectives is that of reducing a covariance estimation problem to that of estimating a sequence of regression problems. We point out several instances of the regression-based formulation. A notable case is in sparse estimation of a precision matrix or a Gaussian graphical model leading to the fast graphical {LASSO} algorithm. Some advantages and limitations of the regression-based Cholesky decomposition relative to the classical spectral (eigenvalue) and variance-correlation decompositions are highlighted. The former provides an unconstrained and statistically interpretable reparameterization, and guarantees the positive-definiteness of the estimated covariance matrix. It reduces the unintuitive task of covariance estimation to that of modeling a sequence of regressions at the cost of imposing an a priori order among the variables. Elementwise regularization of the sample covariance matrix such as banding, tapering and thresholding has desirable asymptotic properties and the sparse estimated covariance matrix is positive definite with probability tending to one for large samples and dimensions.},

Inertial sensor measurements are obtained at high sampling rates and can be integrated to obtain position and orientation information. These estimates are accurate on a short time scale, but suffer from integration drift over longer time scales. To overcome this issue, inertial sensors are typically combined with additional sensors and models. In this tutorial we focus on the signal processing aspects of position and orientation estimation using inertial sensors. We discuss different modeling choices and a selected number of important algorithms. The algorithms include optimization-based smoothing and filtering as well as computationally cheaper extended Kalman filter and complementary filter implementations. The quality of their estimates is illustrated using both experimental and simulated data.},

While navigating the environment, the robot seeks to acquire a map thereof, and at the same time it wishes to localize itself using its map. The use of {SLAM} problems can be motivated in two different ways: one might be interested in detailed environment models, or one might seek to maintain an accurate sense of a mobile robot’s location. {SLAM} serves both of these purposes.We review the three major paradigms from which many published methods for {SLAM} are derived: (1) the extended Kalman filter ({EKF}); (2) particle filtering; and (3) graph optimization. We also review recent work in three-dimensional (3-D ) {SLAM} using visual and red green blue distance-sensors ({RGB}-D), and close with a discussion of open research problems in robotic mapping.},

In recent years improvements in visual sensing capabilities, an ever-increasing focus on long-term mobile robot autonomy, and the ability to draw on state of the art research in other disciplines – particularly recognition in computer vision and animal navigation in neuroscience – have all contributed to significant advances in visual place recognition systems. This paper presents a survey of the visual place recognition research landscape. We start by introducing the concepts behind place recognition – the role of place recognition in the animal kingdom, how a “place” is defined in a robotics context, and the major components of a place recognition system. We then survey visual place recognition solutions for environments where appearance change is assumed to be negligible. Long term robot operations have revealed that environments continually change; consequently we survey place recognition solutions that implicitly or explicitly account for appearance change within the environment. Finally we close with a discussion of the future of visual place recognition, in particular with respect to the rapid advances being made in the related fields of deep learning, semantic scene understanding and video description.},

The technique is based upon solving a sparse system of linear equations coupled with the application of constant-time Kalman updates.

It does so by exploiting our {SLAM} navigation prior within the image registration pipeline and by being selective about which imagery is considered informative in terms of our visual {SLAM} map. A novel online bag-of-words measure for intraand inter-image saliency are introduced, and are shown to be useful for image key-frame selection, information-gain based link hypothesis, and novelty detection.

	abstract = {This paper reports on the problem of map-based visual localization in urban environments for autonomous vehicles. Self-driving cars have become a reality on roadways and are going to be a consumer product in the near future. One of the most significant road-blocks to autonomous vehicles is the prohibitive cost of the sensor suites necessary for localization. The most common sensor on these platforms, a three-dimensional (3D) light detection and ranging ({LIDAR}) scanner, generates dense point clouds with measures of surface reflectivity-which other state-of-the-art localization methods have shown are capable of centimeter-level accuracy. Alternatively, we seek to obtain comparable localization accuracy with significantly cheaper, commodity cameras. We propose to localize a single monocular camera within a 3D prior ground-map, generated by a survey vehicle equipped with 3D {LIDAR} scanners. To do so, we exploit a graphics processing unit to generate several synthetic views of our belief environment. We then seek to maximize the normalized mutual information between our real camera measurements and these synthetic views. Results are shown for two different datasets, a 3.0 km and a 1.5 km trajectory, where we also compare against the state-of-the-art in {LIDAR} map-based localization.},

Necessary and sufﬁcient condition for the existence of two minima is derived and it is shown that more than one minimum exists only when the quality of the local maps used for map joining is extremely poor. The analysis explains to some extent why a number of optimization based {SLAM} algorithms proposed in the recent literature that rely on local search strategies are successful in converging to the globally optimal solution from poor initial conditions, particularly when covariance matrices are spherical. It also demonstrates that the map joining problem has special properties that may be exploited to reliably obtain globally optimal solutions to the {SLAM} problem.},

As a single hand-held {RGB} camera flies over a static scene, we estimate detailed textured depth maps at selected keyframes to produce a surface patchwork with millions of vertices. We use the hundreds of images available in a video stream to improve the quality of a simple photometric data term, and minimise a global spatially regularised energy functional in a novel non-convex optimisation framework. Interleaved, we track the camera's 6DOF motion precisely by frame-rate whole image alignment against the entire dense model. Our algorithms are highly parallelisable throughout and {DTAM} achieves real-time performance using current commodity {GPU} hardware. We demonstrate that a dense model permits superior tracking performance under rapid motion compared to a state of the art method using features; and also show the additional usefulness of the dense model for real-time scene interaction in a physics-enhanced augmented reality application.},

A probabilistic depth measurement is carried out in real time on a per-pixel basis and the computed uncertainty is used to reject erroneous estimations and provide live feedback on the reconstruction progress. Our contribution is a novel approach to depth map computation that combines Bayesian estimation and recent development on convex optimization for image processing. We demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of accuracy, while exhibiting high efficiency in memory usage and computing power. We call our approach {REMODE} ({REgularized} {MOnocular} Depth Estimation). Our {CUDA}-based implementation runs at 30Hz on a laptop computer and is released as open-source software.},

However, low computational speed as well as missing guarantees for optimality and consistency are limiting factors of direct methods, in which established feature-based methods succeed instead. Based on these considerations, we propose a semidirect {VO} ({SVO}) that uses direct methods to track and triangulate pixels that are characterized by high image gradients, but relies on proven feature-based methods for joint optimization of structure and motion. Together with a robust probabilistic depth estimation algorithm, this enables us to efficiently track pixels lying on weak corners and edges in environments with little or high-frequency texture. We further demonstrate that the algorithm can easily be extended to multiple cameras, to track edges, to include motion priors, and to enable the use of very large field of view cameras, such as fisheye and catadioptric ones. Experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets shows that the algorithm is significantly faster than the state of the art while achieving highly competitive accuracy.},

In this work we propose an approach to identify symmetries and exploit them in Structure from Motion ({SfM}). Our ﬁrst contribution is a symmetry detection approach that uses the 3D geometry of the scene as well as 2D appearance clues. We show that a particular parametrization of the transformation space (space in which each point represents a candidate symmetry relation) exposes the dominant symmetries in the scene. Then, we use appearance information to prune incorrect symmetry hypotheses. The second contribution is a constrained bundle adjustment ({CBA}) scheme that jointly optimizes for the best 3D reconstruction and the symmetry generators. Contrarily to related work on {CBA}, our approach models n-fold (rotational and translational) repetitions of architectural elements, and allows estimating a generative model of the 3D geometry. Experimental results conﬁrm that our method can correctly identify and exploit partial symmetries in noisy and sparse {SfM} datasets.},

	abstract = {This manuscript describes the elements of a theory of information tailored to control and decision tasks and specifically to visual data. The concept of Actionable Information is described, that relates to a notion of information championed by J. Gibson, and a notion of "complete information" that relates to the minimal sufficient statistics of a complete representation. It is shown that the "actionable information gap" between the two can be reduced by exercising control on the sensing process. Thus, senging, control and information are inextricably tied. This has consequences in the so-called "signal-to-symbol barrier" problem, as well as in the analysis and design of active sensing systems. It has ramifications in vision-based control, navigation, 3-D reconstruction and rendering, as well as detection, localization, recognition and categorization of objects and scenes in live video. This manuscript has been developed from a set of lecture notes for a summer course at the First International Computer Vision Summer School ({ICVSS}) in Scicli, Italy, in July of 2008. They were later expanded and amended for subsequent lectures in the same School in July 2009.

Previous formulations of {STEAM} used a {GP} prior that assumed either white-noise-on-acceleration ({WNOA}) or white-noise-on-jerk ({WNOJ}). However, previous work did not provide a principled way to choose the continuous-time motion prior or its parameters on a real robotic system. This letter derives a novel data-driven motion prior where ground truth trajectories of a moving robot are used to train a motion prior that better represents the robot's motion. In this approach, we use a prior where latent accelerations are represented as a {GP} with a Matérn covariance function and draw a connection to the Singer acceleration model. We then formulate a variation of {STEAM} using this new prior. We train the {WNOA}, {WNOJ}, and our new latent-force prior and evaluate their performance in the context of both lidar localization and lidar odometry of a car driving along a 20 km route, where we show improved state estimates compared to the two previous formulations.},

Our contribution is to additionally learn parameters of our system models (which may be difﬁcult to choose in practice) within the {ESGVI} framework. In this letter, we learn the covariances for the motion and sensor models used within vehicle trajectory estimation. Speciﬁcally, we learn the parameters of a white-noise-on-acceleration motion model and the parameters of an Inverse-Wishart prior over measurement covariances for our sensor model. We demonstrate our technique using a 36 km dataset consisting of a car using lidar to localize against a high-deﬁnition map; we learn the parameters on a training section of the data and then show that we achieve high-quality state estimates on a test section, even in the presence of outliers.

	abstract = {It is well known that inertial navigation systems can provide high-accuracy position, velocity, and attitude information over short time periods. However, their accuracy rapidly degrades with time. The requirements for an accurate estimation of navigation information necessitate the modeling of the sensors’ error components. Several variance techniques have been devised for stochastic modeling of the error of inertial sensors. They are basically very similar and primarily differ in that various signal processings, by way of weighting functions, window functions, etc., are incorporated into the analysis algorithms in order to achieve a particular desired result for improving the model characterizations. The simplest is the Allan variance. The Allan variance is a method of representing the root means square ({RMS}) randomdrift error as a function of averaging time. It is simple to compute and relatively simple to interpret and understand. The Allan variance method can be used to determine the characteristics of the underlying random processes that give rise to the data noise. This technique can be used to characterize various types of error terms in the inertial-sensor data by performing certain operations on the entire length of data. In this paper, the Allan variance technique will be used in analyzing and modeling the error of the inertial sensors used in different grades of the inertial measurement units. By performing a simple operation on the entire length of data, a characteristic curve is obtained whose inspection provides a systematic characterization of various random errors contained in the inertial-sensor output data. Being a directly measurable quantity, the Allan variance can provide information on the types and magnitude of the various error terms. This paper covers both the theoretical basis for the Allan variance for modeling the inertial sensors’ error terms and its implementation in modeling different grades of inertial sensors.},

The slope method is so prolific; it is referenced among electrical and electronics engineering standards for {IMU} error analysis. However, the graphical nature and visual-inspection–based use of the method limit its ability to be programmed as a generalized algorithm, which hinders the autonomy desired in modern-day navigation computations. Using nonlinear regression with a ridge-regression initial guess, the proposed method is shown to produce comparable results to the gold standard slope method when using standard-length data collections and outperforms the slope method when the amount of available data is limited. This development directly enables accurate navigation solutions for all vehicles in land, air, sea, and space operations.},

We show that, for additive model errors, the estimate of the error covariance converges. We also investigate other forms of model error, such as parametric or multiplicative errors. We show that additive Gaussian model error is able to compensate for non-additive sources of error in the algorithms we propose. We also demonstrate the limitations of the extended version of the algorithm and recommend the use of the more robust and flexible ensemble version. This article is a proof of concept of the methodology with the Lorenz-63 attractor.

	abstract = {We address covariance estimation in the sense of minimum mean-squared error ({MMSE}) when the samples are Gaussian distributed. Speciﬁcally, we consider shrinkage methods which are suitable for high dimensional problems with a small number of samples (large p small n). First, we improve on the Ledoit-Wolf ({LW}) method by conditioning on a sufﬁcient statistic. By the Rao-Blackwell theorem, this yields a new estimator called {RBLW}, whose mean-squared error dominates that of {LW} for Gaussian variables. Second, to further reduce the estimation error, we propose an iterative approach which approximates the clairvoyant shrinkage estimator. Convergence of this iterative method is established and a closed form expression for the limit is determined, which is referred to as the oracle approximating shrinkage ({OAS}) estimator. Both {RBLW} and {OAS} estimators have simple expressions and are easily implemented. Although the two methods are developed from different perspectives, their structure is identical up to speciﬁed constants. The {RBLW} estimator provably dominates the {LW} method for Gaussian samples. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the {OAS} approach can perform even better than {RBLW}, especially when n is much less than p. We also demonstrate the performance of these techniques in the context of adaptive beamforming.},

Given a set of matrices, an iterative algorithm for estimating the parameters of such a mixture model is proposed. The obtained estimates can be interpreted in terms of mean matrices and scale factors. By applying the maximum a posteriori rule, we get an algorithm for the clustering of a set of matrices. This mixture model is then modiﬁed in order to deal with a set of samples. Unfortunately, the samples may be of different sizes. We propose to tackle this problem by considering the cross-product matrix as a signature for each sample. This set of cross-product matrices may be ﬁtted with the proposed Wishart pseudo-mixture model in which the scale parameters of the distribution are not estimated but ﬁxed. Again, we easily get a clustering algorithm from ﬁnal parameter estimates. The different estimators are studied empirically through an analysis of their bias and variance and are validated onto an artiﬁcial dataset. Finally, we apply the Wishart pseudo-mixture model for analyzing motion-captured movements. Given the successive 3D positions of markers over the time, a cross-product matrix is constructed for each movement and put into the proposed classiﬁer. We observe that the recognition rates are higher with our proposed approach than those with other geometric methods. Limits and constraints of the provided models are ﬁnally discussed.},

	title = {Underwater Navigation using the Invariant Extended Kalman Filter Framework},
	abstract = {In underwater navigation applications, the extended Kalman ﬁlter ({EKF}) has historically been the ﬁlter of choice. However, the {EKF} error dynamics are generally state dependent, resulting in poor convergence properties and, in some cases, divergence of the state estimate. The invariant {EKF} ({IEKF}) deﬁnes the error dynamics in a state independent way resulting in much more robust and reliable state estimates. This paper’s contribution is the application of the {IEKF} framework to the underwater navigation problem. Due to the nature of kinematics and sensors in this problem, the {IEKF} framework cannot be directly applied. It is shown that it is best to prioritize the preservation of the invariant properties of the measurement model over the preservation of the group-afﬁne properties of the process model when implementing an {IEKF}. Three approximate {IEKFs} are presented and are compared to traditional {EKFs} in both simulation and experiments. The results presented in this paper show that the {IEKF} framework realizes improved state estimates compared to traditional {EKFs}, even in the case of an approximative {IEKF} implementation where the error dynamics are not group afﬁne.},

The feedforward controller is constructed by ﬁrst constructing an invertible feedback controller that asymptotically stabilizes the {NMP} plant, and then setting the feedforward controller to be the inverse of the feedback controller. In the ﬁrst part of this thesis, pole-placement and nonlinear optimization are used to construct an H2-optimal feedback controller that shapes the poles of the closed loop of the {NMP} plant for the given poles and for the given feedback controller order and relative degree. In the second part of this thesis, a linear matrix-inequality ({LMI}) formulation is presented to construct a strictly positive real ({SPR}), invertible, dynamic feedback controller that renders the closed loop of the {NMP} plant asymptotically stable using the Lyapunov inequality and the Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov ({KYP}) Lemma. A similar {LMI} formulation is then presented to construct an extended strictly positive real ({ESPR}) dynamic feedback controller that renders the closed loop descriptor system of the {NMP} plant admissible using the Generalized Lyapunov Equation and the {KYP} Lemma for descriptor systems.},

	abstract = {In a distributed estimation system, the fusion center receives the local estimates from sensors and fuses them to be an optimal estimation in terms of some criterion. Recently, the best linear unbiased estimation ({BLUE}) fusion was proposed to minimize the mean square error of the fused estimate, in which the weights to optimally combine the local estimates are determined by the covariance matrix of estimation errors. While the cross-correlations of estimation errors are unknown, which is very often in practice, the covariance intersection ({CI}) filter provides an estimate of the determinate parameters or states according to the minimax criterion. Unfortunately, there are still some obviously disadvantages in that strategy. In this paper, for the case of the estimation error covariance between different sensors being unknown, a robust estimation fusion ({REF}) is derived to minimize the worst-case estimation error on some given parameter set, in which the fusion weights are determined by solving a semidefinite program. Specifically, the {REF} is the nonlinear combination of local estimates. The simulations show that the proposed approach has better performance than the {CI} filter.},

This structure is computationally expensive to maintain and is not robust to linearization errors. In this tutorial we describe {SLAM} algorithms that attempt to circumvent these difficulties through the use of Covariance Intersection ({CI}). {CI} is the optimal algorithm for fusing estimates when the correlations among them are unknown. A feature of {CI} relative to techniques which exploit full correlation information is that it provides provable consistency with much less computational overhead. In practice, however, a tradeoff typically needs to be made between estimation accuracy and computational cost. We describe a number of techniques that span the range of tradeoffs from maximum computational efficiency with straight {CI} to maximum estimation efficiency with the maintenance of all correlation information. We present a set of examples illustrating benefits of {CI}-based {SLAM}.},

	abstract = {The measurement selection for updating the state estimate of a target's track, known as data association, is essential for good performance in the presence of spurious measurements or clutter. A classification of tracking and data association approaches has been presented, as a pure {MMSE} approach, which amounts to a soft decision, and single best-hypothesis approach, which amounts to a hard decision. It has been shown that the optimal state estimator in the presence of data association uncertainty consists of the computation of the conditional pdf of the state x(k) given all information available at time k, namely, the prior information about the initial state, the intervening known inputs, and the sets of measurements through time k. It has also been pointed out that if the exact conditional pdf, which is a mixture, is available, then its recursion requires only the probabilities of the most recent association events. The conditions under which this result holds, namely whiteness of the noise, detection, and clutter processes, were presented. The {PDAF} and {JPDAF} algorithms, which carry out data association and state estimation in clutter, have been described. A simple example was given to illustrate how the clutter and occasional missed detections can lead to track loss for a standard tracking filter, and how {PDAF} can keep the target in track under such circumstances. By using the Monte Carlo in a simulated based surveillance as an exampled shown. The numerous applications of the {PDAF}/{JPDAF} illustrated in "Real-World Applications of {PDAF} and {JPDAF}" show the potential pitfalls of using sophisticated algorithms for tracking in difficult environments as well as how to overcome them. The effect of finite sensor resolution can be a more severe problem than the data association and deserves special attention.},

	abstract = {From disinfection and remote triage, to logistics and delivery, countries around the world are making use of robots to address the unique challenges presented by the {COVID}-19 pandemic. Robots are being used to manage the pandemic in Canada too, but relative to other regions, we have been more cautious in our adoption -- this despite the important role that robots of Canadian origin are now playing on the global stage. This white paper discusses why this is the case, and argues that strategic investment and support for the Canadian robotics industry are urgently needed to bring the benefits of robotics home, where we have more control in shaping the future of this game-changing technology. Such investments will not only serve to support Canada's current pandemic response and post pandemic recovery, but will also prepare this country to weather future crises. Without such support, Canada risks falling behind other developed nations that are investing heavily in hardware automation at this time.},

Most Bayesian ﬁlters assume the availability of such an explicit process model and thus may require additional assumptions or fail to properly leverage all available information. In contrast, we propose a ﬁlter which employs a purely residual based modeling of the available information and thus achieves higher modeling ﬂexibility. While this work is related to the descriptor Kalman ﬁlter, it also represents a step towards batch optimization and allows the integration of further techniques such as robust weighting for outlier rejection. We derive recursive ﬁlter equations which exhibit similar computational complexity when compared to their Kalman ﬁlter counterpart – the extended information ﬁlter. The applicability of the proposed approach is experimentally conﬁrmed on two different real mobile robotic state estimation problems.},

We propose to leverage smartphones to equip robots with extensive sensor suites, powerful computational abilities, state-of-the-art communication channels, and access to a thriving software ecosystem. We design a small electric vehicle that costs \$50 and serves as a robot body for standard Android smartphones. We develop a software stack that allows smartphones to use this body for mobile operation and demonstrate that the system is sufficiently powerful to support advanced robotics workloads such as person following and real-time autonomous navigation in unstructured environments. Controlled experiments demonstrate that the presented approach is robust across different smartphones and robot bodies.

While deep neural networks have become the prominent solution to many tasks in computer vision, some important problems not so well suited for deep models have received less attention. These include uncertainty quantiﬁcation, auxiliary data fusion, and real-time processing, which are instrumental for delivering practical methods with robust inference. While these are central goals in probabilistic machine learning, there is a tangible gap between the theory and practice of applying probabilistic methods to many modern vision problems. For this, we derive a novel parametric kernel (covariance function) in the pose space, {SE}(3), that encodes information about input pose relationships into larger models. We show how this soft-prior knowledge can be applied to improve performance on several real vision tasks, such as feature tracking, human face encoding, and view synthesis.},

	abstract = {In this work we present a new generalization of the geometric mean of positive numbers on symmetric positive-deﬁnite matrices, called Log-Euclidean. The approach is based on two novel algebraic structures on symmetric positive-deﬁnite matrices: ﬁrst, a lie group structure which is compatible with the usual algebraic properties of this matrix space; second, a new scalar multiplication that smoothly extends the Lie group structure into a vector space structure. From biinvariant metrics on the Lie group structure, we deﬁne the Log-Euclidean mean from a Riemannian point of view. This notion coincides with the usual Euclidean mean associated with the novel vector space structure. Furthermore, this means corresponds to an arithmetic mean in the domain of matrix logarithms. We detail the invariance properties of this novel geometric mean and compare it to the recently introduced aﬃne-invariant mean. The two means have the same determinant and are equal in a number of cases, yet they are not identical in general. Indeed, the Log-Euclidean mean has a larger trace whenever they are not equal. Last but not least, the Log-Euclidean mean is much easier to compute.},

We consider quantum clocks constructed from the internal degrees of relativistic particles that move through curved spacetime. The probability that one clock reads a given proper time conditioned on another clock reading a different proper time is derived. From this conditional probability distribution, it is shown that when the center-of-mass of these clocks move in localized momentum wave packets they observe classical time dilation. We then illustrate a quantum correction to the time dilation observed by a clock moving in a superposition of localized momentum wave packets that has the potential to be observed in experiment.

	abstract = {This paper considers nonlinear state estimation subject to inequality constraints in the form of linear and linear-matrix inequalities. Rewriting the standard maximum likelihood objective function used to derive the Kalman ﬁlter allows the Kalman gain to be found by solving a constrained optimization problem with a linear objective function subject to a linear-matrix-inequality constraint. Additional constraints, such as weighted-norm- or linear-inequality constraints, that the state estimate must satisfy are easily augmented to the constrained optimization problem. The proposed constrained estimation methodology is applied in the extended Kalman ﬁlter ({EKF}) and sigma point Kalman ﬁlter ({SPKF}) frameworks. Motivated by estimation problems involving a vehicle that can rotate and translate in space, multiplicative versions of the constrained {EKF} and {SPKF} formulations are discussed. Simulation results for a ground-based mobile robot operating in a constrained threedimensional terrain are presented and are compared to results that use the traditional multiplicative {EKF} and {SPKF}, as well as ﬁlters that enforce inequality constraints by simply projecting the state estimate into the constrained domain along the shortest Euclidean distance.},

For example, many statistical estimators and ﬁlters provide assessments of the ﬁrst two moments of their own estimation error (i.e., mean-square error [{MSE}] or error covariance matrix and bias). Are these assessments credible in that they reﬂect the true situation? The paper addresses this important yet little studied topic, referred to as the credibility of the assessments (or the estimators that make the assessments). We deﬁne the concept of credibility and formulate three classes of commonly encountered credibility-testing problems: {MSE} alone, bias alone, and {MSE} and bias jointly. Taking advantage of results in multivariate statistical analysis, we present several statistical tests for the credibility problems formulated and analyze and discuss in detail pros and cons of the proposed tests, contrasting with the existing test. How these tests can be used and how they perform are illustrated by representative numerical examples. For the existing {MSE} credibility test, we explain its underlying principle and analyze, discuss, and demonstrate its drawbacks and limitations. We also propose a test for comparing different credibility assessments.},

	abstract = {We consider optimization problems on manifolds with equality and inequality constraints. A large body of work treats constrained optimization in Euclidean spaces. In this work, we consider extensions of existing algorithms from the Euclidean case to the Riemannian case. Thus, the variable lives on a known smooth manifold and is further constrained. In doing so, we exploit the growing literature on unconstrained Riemannian optimization. For the special case where the manifold is itself described by equality constraints, one could in principle treat the whole problem as a constrained problem in a Euclidean space. The main hypothesis we test here is whether it is sometimes better to exploit the geometry of the constraints, even if only for a subset of them. Specifically, this paper extends an augmented Lagrangian method and smoothed versions of an exact penalty method to the Riemannian case, together with some fundamental convergence results. Numerical experiments indicate some gains in computational efficiency and accuracy in some regimes for minimum balanced cut, non-negative {PCA} and \$k\$-means, especially in high dimensions.},

The uncertainties are better accounted for than in {GP} regression, because the predictive covariances explicitly depend on the training observations. For an entangled noise model, the canonical-form {TP} regression problem can be solved analytically, but the naive {TP} and {GP} solutions share the same cubic computational cost in the number of training observations. We show how a large class of temporal {TP} regression models can be reformulated as state space models, and how a forward ﬁltering and backward smoothing recursion can be derived for solving the inference analytically in linear time complexity. This is a novel ﬁnding that generalizes the previously known connection between Gaussian process regression and Kalman ﬁltering to more general elliptical processes and non-Gaussian Bayesian ﬁltering. We derive this connection, demonstrate the beneﬁts of the approach with examples, and ﬁnally apply the method to empirical data.},

We employ Student-t process quadrature, an instance of Bayesian quadrature, which allows us to treat the integral itself as a random variable whose variance provides information about the incurred integration error. Advantage of the Student-t process quadrature over the traditional Gaussian process quadrature, is that the integral variance depends also on the function values, allowing for a more robust modelling of the integration error. The moment transform is applied in nonlinear sigma-point ﬁltering and evaluated on two numerical examples, where it is shown to outperform the state-of-the-art moment transforms.},

We referred to these problems as the credibility of the estimators/filters. Solid technical answers to the first question are provided in two companion papers for this conference based on statistical hypothesis testing. Complementary to those, we answer the second question in this paper by proposing a family of metrics, called noncredibility indices ({NCI}) and inclination indicators (I2), that measure how credible various self-assessments are. We show that the {NCI} and I have many desirable properties and are more appropriate than a bunch of possible alternatives and by far superior to a heuristic measure currently in use explicitly or implicitly.

This paper addresses four of the most widespread ones, particularly in statistical processing of signals, data, and information in uncertainty. They concern the decision on a single hypothesis, the assignment of the null hypothesis in the Neyman-Pearson framework, the confusion between two classes of significance tests, and the interpretation of a hypothesis not rejected. We articulate the principle underlying the tests, explain and analyze where the fallacies and confusions arise from, and present convincing arguments, clear conclusions, and succinct guidelines for practice, along with detailed, representative examples.},

For example, Gibbs’ three-vectors, Minkowski four-vectors, complex spinors in quantum mechanics, quaternions used to describe rigid body rotations and vectors deﬁned in Clifford geometric algebra. With such a range of vector formalisms in use, it thus appears that there is as yet no general agreement on a vector formalism suitable for science as a whole. This is surprising, in that, one of the primary goals of nineteenth century science was to suitably describe vectors in three-dimensional space. This situation has also had the unfortunate consequence of fragmenting knowledge across many disciplines, and requiring a signiﬁcant amount of time and effort in learning the various formalisms. We thus historically review the development of our various vector systems and conclude that Clifford’s multivectors best fulﬁlls the goal of describing vectorial quantities in three dimensions and providing a uniﬁed vector system for science.},

	abstract = {This work focuses on developing theory and methodologies for the analysis of material transport in stochastic fluid flows. In a first part, two dominant classes of techniques for extracting Lagrangian Coherent Structures are reviewed and compared and some improvements are suggested for their pragmatic applications on realistic high-dimensional deterministic ocean velocity fields. In the stochastic case, estimating the uncertain Lagrangian motion can require to evaluate an ensemble of realizations of the flow map associated with a random velocity flow field, or equivalently realizations of the solution of a related transport partial differential equation. The Dynamically Orthogonal ({DO}) approximation is applied as an efficient model order reduction technique to solve this stochastic advection equation. With the goal of developing new rigorous reduced-order advection schemes, the second part of this work investigates the mathematical foundations of the method. Riemannian geometry providing an appropriate setting, a framework free of tensor notations is used to analyze the embedded geometry of three popular matrix manifolds, namely the fixed rank manifold, the Stiefel manifold and the isospectral manifold. Their extrinsic curvatures are characterized and computed through the study of the Weingarten map. As a spectacular by-product, explicit formulas are found for the differential of the truncated Singular Value Decomposition, of the Polar Decomposition, and of the eigenspaces of a time dependent symmetric matrix. Convergent gradient flows that achieve related algebraic operations are provided. A generalization of this framework to the non-Euclidean case is provided, allowing to derive analogous formulas and dynamical systems for tracking the eigenspaces of non-symmetric matrices. In the geometric setting, the {DO} approximation is a particular case of projected dynamical systems, that applies instantaneously the {SVD} truncation to optimally constrain the rank of the reduced solution. It is obtained that the error committed by the {DO} approximation is controlled under the minimal geometric condition that the original solution stays close to the low-rank manifold. The last part of the work focuses on the practical implementation of the {DO} methodology for the stochastic advection equation. Fully linear, explicit central schemes are selected to ensure stability, accuracy and efficiency of the method. Riemannian matrix optimization is applied for the dynamic evaluation of the dominant {SVD} of a given matrix and is integrated to the {DO} time-stepping. Finally the technique is illustrated numerically on the uncertainty quantification of the Lagrangian motion of two bi-dimensional benchmark flows.},

	abstract = {A generalization of the concepts of extrinsic curvature and  Weingarten endomorphism is introduced to study a class of nonlinear maps over embedded matrix manifolds. These (nonlinear) oblique projections generalize (nonlinear) orthogonal projections, i.e., applications mapping a point to its closest neighbor on a matrix manifold.  Examples of such maps include the truncated {SVD}, the polar decomposition, and functions  mapping symmetric and nonsymmetric matrices to their linear eigenprojectors.  This paper specifically investigates how oblique projections provide their image manifolds with a canonical extrinsic differential structure,  over which a generalization of the Weingarten identity is available. By diagonalization of the corresponding Weingarten endomorphism, the manifold principal curvatures are explicitly characterized, which then enables us to (i) derive explicit formulas for the differential of oblique projections and (ii) study the global stability of a governing generic ordinary differential equation ({ODE}) computing their values.  This methodology, exploited for the truncated {SVD} in [Feppon and Lermusiaux, {SIAM} J. Matrix Anal.  Appl., 39 (2018), pp. 510--538], is generalized to non-Euclidean settings and applied to the four other maps mentioned above and their image manifolds: respectively, the Stiefel, the isospectral, and the Grassmann manifolds and the manifold of fixed rank (nonorthogonal) linear projectors. In all cases studied, the oblique projection of a target matrix is surprisingly the unique stable equilibrium point of the above gradient flow. Three numerical applications concerned with {ODEs} tracking dominant eigenspaces involving possibly multiple eigenvalues finally showcase the results.},

	series = {Other Titles in Applied Mathematics},
	abstract = {The advent of high-speed computers and sophisticated software tools has made the computation of derivatives for functions defined by evaluation programs both easier and more important. On one hand, the dependence of certain program outputs on certain input parameters can now be determined and quantified more or less automatically, i.e., without the user having to append or rewrite the function evaluation procedure. On the other hand, such qualitative and quantitative dependence analysis is invaluable for the optimization of key output objectives with respect to suitable decision variables or the identification of model parameters with respect to given data. In fact, we may juxtapose the mere simulation of a physical or social system by the repeated running of an appropriate computer model for various input data with its optimization by a systematic adjustment of certain decision variables and model parameters. The transition from the former computational paradigm to the latter may be viewed as a central characteristic of present-day scientific computing. Optimization nowadays already forms an important application area for exact derivative calculation using algorithmic differentiation. This includes the provision of gradients and Hessians for the unconstrained case, as, for example, in nonlinear finite element calculations [Wri08], the optimal laser control of chemical reactions [{BCL}01] or the optimization of low-pass analog filters [Alk98]. In the constrained case, algorithmic differentiation can be used to compute the required Jacobians, Hessians, or Hessian-vector products. Here, the applications areas include chemical engineering [{AB}04], race car performance [{CS}+01], and industrial production processes [{KW}00]. Since 1997 the Network Enabled Optimization Server ({NEOS}) at Argonne National Laboratory has been using algorithmic differentiation to compute gradients and Jacobians of remotely supplied user code for optimization objectives and constraints [{CMM}97]. The modelling language {AMPL} and {GAMS} have incorporated both modes of algorithmic differentiation to provide first and second derivatives for various optimization solvers. Also multicriteria optimization benefits from exact derivatives, e.g., to optimize medical radiotherapy [{JMF}06]. For the field of parameter estimation, algorithmic differentiation is used to improve, for example, weather models [{GK}+06] or the simulation of the climate [{KHL}06]. The cover shows the independence between various vector quantities in optimal design as discussed in Chapter 15 superimposed on a global sensitivity map. It was provided to us by Patrick Heimbach of {MIT} and represents the derivative of the poleward heat transfer with respect to local maritime temperatures.},

Since a common use of a large matrix like H is to compute its product with various vectors, we derive a technique that directly calculates Hv, where v is an arbitrary vector. To calculate Hv, we first define a differential operator R
              v

We then apply the technique to a one pass gradient calculation algorithm (backpropagation), a relaxation gradient calculation algorithm (recurrent backpropagation), and two stochastic gradient calculation algorithms (Boltzmann machines and weight perturbation). Finally, we show that this technique can be used at the heart of many iterative techniques for computing various properties of H, obviating any need to calculate the full Hessian.},

	abstract = {An introduction to both automatic diﬀerentiation and object-oriented programming can enrich a numerical analysis course that typically incorporates numerical diﬀerentiation and basic {MATLAB} computation. Automatic diﬀerentiation consists of exact algorithms on ﬂoating-point arguments. This implementation overloads standard elementary operators and functions in {MATLAB} with a derivative rule in addition to the function value; for example, sin u will also compute (cos u) ∗ u , where u and u are numerical values. These methods are mostly one-line programs that operate on a class of value-and-derivative objects, providing a simple example of object-oriented programming in {MATLAB} using the new (as of release 2008a) class deﬁnition structure. The resulting powerful tool computes derivative values and multivariable gradients, and is applied to Newton’s method for rootﬁnding in both single and multivariable settings. To compute higher-order derivatives of a single-variable function, another class of series objects keeps Taylor polynomial coeﬃcients up to some order. Overloading multiplication on series objects is a combination (discrete convolution) of coeﬃcients. This idea leads to algorithms for other operations and functions on series objects. A survey of more advanced topics in automatic diﬀerentiation includes an introduction to the reverse mode (our implementation is forward mode) and considerations in arbitrary-order multivariable series computation.},

This makes interest point detectors non-trivial to build. In this work, we introduce an unsupervised deep learning-based interest point detector and descriptor. Using a self-supervised approach, we utilize a siamese network and a novel loss function that enables interest point scores and positions to be learned automatically. The resulting interest point detector and descriptor is {UnsuperPoint}. We use regression of point positions to 1) make {UnsuperPoint} end-to-end trainable and 2) to incorporate non-maximum suppression in the model. Unlike most trainable detectors, it requires no generation of pseudo ground truth points, no structure-from-motion-generated representations and the model is learned from only one round of training. Furthermore, we introduce a novel loss function to regularize network predictions to be uniformly distributed. {UnsuperPoint} runs in real-time with 323 frames per second (fps) at a resolution of \$224{\textbackslash}times320\$ and 90 fps at \$480{\textbackslash}times640\$.

	abstract = {A new input estimation ({IE}) model for problems in tracking manoeuvring targets is proposed. The proposed model is constructed by combining the two models of uncertainties, Bayesian and Fisher. The conventional model, which describes targets with manoeuvre, is based on the state vector of target position and velocity. The acceleration is treated as an additive input term in the corresponding state equation. The proposed method is a Kalman filter-based tracking scheme with the {IE} approach. The proposed model is a special augmentation in the state-space model which considers both the state vector and the unknown input vector as a new augmented state vector. In the proposed scheme, the original state and acceleration vectors are estimated simultaneously with a standard Kalman filter. The proposed tracking algorithm operates in both the non-manoeuvring and the manoeuvring modes and the manoeuvre detection procedure is eliminated. The theoretical development is verified by simulation results, which also contain some examples of tracking typical target manoeuvres. The results are compared with a traditional {IE} method. A comparison based on the Monte-Carlo simulation is also made to evaluate the performances of the proposed method in three scenarios: low, medium and high manoeuvring target.},

	title = {Robust Gaussian Process Regression with a Student-t Likelihood},
	abstract = {This paper considers the robust and efﬁcient implementation of Gaussian process regression with a Student-t observation model, which has a non-log-concave likelihood. The challenge with the Student-t model is the analytically intractable inference which is why several approximative methods have been proposed. Expectation propagation ({EP}) has been found to be a very accurate method in many empirical studies but the convergence of {EP} is known to be problematic with models containing non-log-concave site functions. In this paper we illustrate the situations where standard {EP} fails to converge and review different modiﬁcations and alternative algorithms for improving the convergence. We demonstrate that convergence problems may occur during the type-{II} maximum a posteriori ({MAP}) estimation of the hyperparameters and show that standard {EP} may not converge in the {MAP} values with some difﬁcult data sets. We present a robust implementation which relies primarily on parallel {EP} updates and uses a moment-matching-based double-loop algorithm with adaptively selected step size in difﬁcult cases. The predictive performance of {EP} is compared with Laplace, variational Bayes, and Markov chain Monte Carlo approximations.},

The book illustrates and motivates these ideas and algorithms by showing how they are applied to the estimation of geometric locations and paths. The estimation techniques that we discuss make two important assumptions. First, we assume that the quantities that we measure are generated from the unknown vector in a known way. For example, a {GPS} receiver at a location x measures the arrival times b1,…, bm of signals that were transmitted from known locations (in space) at known times. The exact arrival times are functions of the unknown location, bi = Mi(x), where Mi is a known function, at least approximately. Second, we assume that the statistical behavior of measurement errors is known. For example, we might assume that while our {GPS} receiver cannot determine Mi(x) exactly, it can observe or estimate bi = Mi(x) + ϵi, where ϵ is a random vector with a known distribution (again, perhaps only approximately known). The techniques and algorithms that this book teaches use the vector b, our knowledge of M, and knowledge of the distribution of ϵ to estimate x and to assess the accuracy of this estimate.},

	series = {Graduate Texts in Mathematics},
	abstract = {This textbook is designed for a one or two semester graduate course on Riemannian geometry for students who are familiar with topological and differentiable manifolds. The second edition has been adapted, expanded, and aptly retitled from Lee's earlier book, Riemannian Manifolds: An Introduction to Curvature. Numerous exercises and problem sets provide the student with opportunities to practice and develop skills; appendices contain a brief review of essential background material. While demonstrating the uses of most of the main technical tools needed for a careful study of Riemannian manifolds, this text focuses on ensuring that the student develops an intimate acquaintance with the geometric meaning of curvature. The reasonably broad coverage begins with a treatment of indispensable tools for working with Riemannian metrics such as connections and geodesics. Several topics have been added, including an expanded treatment of pseudo-Riemannian metrics, a more detailed treatment of homogeneous spaces and invariant metrics, a completely revamped treatment of comparison theory based on Riccati equations, and a handful of new local-to-global theorems, to name just a few highlights. Reviews of the first edition: Arguments and proofs are written down precisely and clearly. The expertise of the author is reflected in many valuable comments and remarks on the recent developments of the subjects. Serious readers would have the challenges of solving the exercises and problems. The book is probably one of the most easily accessible introductions to Riemannian geometry. (M.C. Leung, {MathReview}) The book's aim is to develop tools and intuition for studying the central unifying theme in Riemannian geometry, which is the notion of curvature and its relation with topology. The main ideas of the subject, motivated as in the original papers, are introduced here in an intuitive and accessible way...The book is an excellent introduction designed for a one-semester graduate course, containing exercises and problems which encourage students to practice working with the new notions and develop skills for later use. By citing suitable references for detailed study, the reader is stimulated to inquire into further research. (C.-L. Bejan, {zBMATH})},

	abstract = {Recent results in monocular visual-inertial navigation ({VIN}) have shown that optimization-based approaches outperform ﬁltering methods in terms of accuracy due to their capability to relinearize past states. However, the improvement comes at the cost of increased computational complexity. In this paper, we address this issue by preintegrating inertial measurements between selected keyframes. The preintegration allows us to accurately summarize hundreds of inertial measurements into a single relative motion constraint. Our ﬁrst contribution is a preintegration theory that properly addresses the manifold structure of the rotation group and carefully deals with uncertainty propagation. The measurements are integrated in a local frame, which eliminates the need to repeat the integration when the linearization point changes while leaving the opportunity for belated bias corrections. The second contribution is to show that the preintegrated {IMU} model can be seamlessly integrated in a visual-inertial pipeline under the unifying framework of factor graphs. This enables the use of a structureless model for visual measurements, further accelerating the computation. The third contribution is an extensive evaluation of our monocular {VIN} pipeline: experimental results conﬁrm that our system is very fast and demonstrates superior accuracy with respect to competitive state-of-the-art ﬁltering and optimization algorithms, including off-the-shelf systems such as Google Tango [1].},

	abstract = {{SDPNAL}+ is a \{{\textbackslash}sc Matlab\} software package that implements an augmented Lagrangian based method to solve large scale semidefinite programming problems with bound constraints. The implementation was initially based on a majorized semismooth Newton-{CG} augmented Lagrangian method, here we designed it within an inexact symmetric Gauss-Seidel based semi-proximal {ADMM}/{ALM} (alternating direction method of multipliers/augmented Lagrangian method) framework for the purpose of deriving simpler stopping conditions and closing the gap between the practical implementation of the algorithm and the theoretical algorithm. The basic code is written in \{{\textbackslash}sc Matlab\}, but some subroutines in C language are incorporated via Mex files. We also design a convenient interface for users to input their {SDP} models into the solver. Numerous problems arising from combinatorial optimization and binary integer quadratic programming problems have been tested to evaluate the performance of the solver. Extensive numerical experiments conducted in [Yang, Sun, and Toh, Mathematical Programming Computation, 7 (2015), pp. 331--366] show that the proposed method is quite efficient and robust, in that it is able to solve 98.9{\textbackslash}\% of the 745 test instances of {SDP} problems arising from various applications to the accuracy of \$ 10{\textasciicircum}\{-6\}\$ in the relative {KKT} residual.},

Eventually we consider how noise behaves under common signal transformations, such as frequency filters, quantisation and impulse generation and we explore how these signal transformations must be designed in order generate sampling-rate-aware results when applied to white noise.},

The problem is ﬁrst formulated in terms of graph embedding: a graph describing robot poses at subsequent instants of time needs be embedded in a three-dimensional space, assuring that the estimated conﬁguration maximizes measurement likelihood. Combining tools belonging to linear estimation and graph theory, a closed-form approximation to the full {SLAM} problem is proposed, under the assumption that the relative position and the relative orientation measurements are independent. The approach needs no initial guess for optimization and is formally proven to admit solution under the {SLAM} setup. The resulting estimate can be used as an approximation of the actual nonlinear solution or can be further reﬁned by using it as an initial guess for nonlinear optimization techniques. Finally, the experimental analysis demonstrates that such reﬁnement is often unnecessary, since the linear estimate is already accurate.},

	abstract = {Estimating the orientations of nodes in a pose graph from relative angular measurements is challenging because the variables live on a manifold product with nontrivial topology and the maximum-likelihood objective function is non-convex and has multiple local minima; these issues prevent iterative solvers to be robust for large amounts of noise. This paper presents an approach that allows working around the problem of multiple minima, and is based on the insight that the original estimation problem on orientations is equivalent to an unconstrained quadratic optimization problem on integer vectors. This equivalence provides a viable way to compute the maximum likelihood estimate and allows guaranteeing that such estimate is almost surely unique. A deeper consequence of the derivation is that the maximum likelihood solution does not necessarily lead to an estimate that is “close” to the actual nodes orientations, hence it is not necessarily the best choice for the problem at hand. To alleviate this issue, our algorithm computes a set of estimates, for which we can derive precise probabilistic guarantees. Experiments show that the method is able to tolerate extreme amounts of noise (e.g., σ = 30◦ on each measurement) that are above all noise levels of sensors commonly used in mapping. For most range-ﬁnder-based scenarios, the multihypothesis estimator returns only a single hypothesis, because the problem is very well constrained. Finally, using the orientations estimate provided by our method to bootstrap the initial guess of pose graph optimization methods improves their robustness and makes them avoid local minima even for high levels of noise.},

In linear stochastic state-space representations the true noise covariances are generally unknown in practical applications. Using estimated covariances a Kalman filter can be tuned in order to increase the accuracy of the state estimates. There is a linear relationship between covariances and autocovariance. Therefore, the covariance estimation problem can be stated as a least-squares problem, which can be solved as a symmetric semidefinite least-squares problem. This problem is convex and can be solved efficiently by interior-point methods. A numerical algorithm for solving the symmetric is able to handle systems with mutually correlated process noise and measurement noise.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the novel insight that the simultaneous localization and mapping ({SLAM}) information matrix is exactly sparse in a delayed-state framework. Such a framework is used in view-based representations of the environment that rely upon scan-matching raw sensor data to obtain virtual observations of robot motion with respect to a place it has previously been. The exact sparseness of the delayed-state information matrix is in contrast to other recent feature-based {SLAM} information algorithms, such as sparse extended information ﬁlters or thin junction-tree ﬁlters, since these methods have to make approximations in order to force the feature-based {SLAM} information matrix to be sparse. The beneﬁt of the exact sparsity of the delayed-state framework is that it allows one to take advantage of the information space parameterization without incurring any sparse approximation error. Therefore, it can produce equivalent results to the full-covariance solution. The approach is validated experimentally using monocular imagery for two datasets: a test tank experiment with ground-truth, and a remotely operated vehicle survey of the {RMS} Titanic.},

Several provably convergent approaches have been successfully developed using linear programming ({LP}) relaxation of the {MAP} problem. We present an alternative approach, which transforms the {MAP} problem into that of inference in a mixture of simple Bayes nets. We then derive the Expectation Maximization ({EM}) algorithm for this mixture that also monotonically increases a lower bound on the {MAP} assignment until convergence. The update equations for the {EM} algorithm are remarkably simple, both conceptually and computationally, and can be implemented using a graph-based message passing paradigm similar to max-product computation. Experiments on the real-world protein design dataset show that {EM}’s convergence rate is signiﬁcantly higher than the previous {LP} relaxation based approach {MPLP}. {EM} also achieves a solution quality within 95\% of optimal for most instances.},

Our contribution are as follows: 1) we show that absolute orientation can be estimated using local structural cues; and 2) we develop a method to incorporate absolute orientation measurements in both the front and back-end of pose-graph {SLAM}.

The object of the optimization is to ﬁnd the most likely conﬁguration of global poses given ﬁxed relative transformation constraints produced in the front-end. However, the relative transformations delivered by the front-end are themselves only estimates. In this paper we show how making relative transformations the focus of the back-end optimization leads to a novel algorithm that iteratively improves the joint estimate of global poses and relative transformations. We test the algorithm on frontend data from a 225 meter closed-loop trajectory. Our results show the algorithm provides the same global pose estimates in slightly less computational time when compared to g2o, a state-of-the-art back-end optimization tool. But the optimized relative transformations produced by g2o require several iterations before they become more accurate than their initial values. The algorithm presented in this paper offers advantages over traditional back-end optimization in at least two ways. It uses the covariance instead of the information form, allowing ready access to marginal covariance elements needed by the front-end. It also improves both global pose and relative transformation estimates at each iteration, making the end result of the optimization suitable to a wider variety of applications.},

	shorttitle = {The essential message},
	abstract = {In 1948, Claude Shannon, a young engineer and mathematician working at the Bell Telephone Laboratories, published "A Mathematical Theory of Communication," a seminal paper that marked the birth of information theory. In that paper, Shannon defined what the once fuzzy concept of "information" meant for communication engineers and proposed a precise way to quantify it-in his theory, the fundamental unit of information is the bit. He also showed how data could be "compressed" before transmission and how virtually error-free communication could be achieved. The concepts Shannon developed in his paper are at the heart of today's digital information technology. {CDs}, {DVDs}, cell phones, fax machines, modems, computer networks, hard drives, memory chips, encryption schemes, {MP}3 music, optical communication, high-definition television-all these things embody many of Shannon's ideas and others inspired by him. But despite the importance of his work and its influence on everyday life, Claude Shannon is still unknown to most people. Many papers, theses, books, and articles on information theory have been published, but none have explored in detail and in accessible language aimed at a general audience what the theory is about, how it changed the world of communication, and-most importantly-what path led Shannon to his revolutionary ideas. "The Essential Message" presents an account of the making of information theory based on papers, letters, interviews with Shannon and his colleagues, and other sources. It describes the context in which Shannon was immersed, the main ideas in his 1948 paper-and the reaction to it-and how his theory shaped the technologies that changed one of the most fundamental activities in our lives: communication.},

	abstract = {In this paper we describe a relative approach to simultaneous localization and mapping, based on the insight that a continuous relative representation can make the problem tractable at large scales. First, it is well known that bundle adjustment is the optimal non-linear leastsquares formulation for this problem, in that its maximum-likelihood form matches the definition of the Cramer–Rao lower bound. Unfortunately, computing the maximum-likelihood solution is often prohibitively expensive: this is especially true during loop closures, which often necessitate adjusting all parameters in a loop. In this paper we note that it is precisely the choice of a single privileged coordinate frame that makes bundle adjustment costly, and that this expense can be avoided by adopting a completely relative approach. We derive a new relative bundle adjustment which, instead of optimizing in a single Euclidean space, works in a metric space defined by a manifold. Using an adaptive optimization strategy, we show experimentally that it is possible to solve for the full maximum-likelihood solution incrementally in constant time, even at loop closure. Our approach is, by definition, everywhere locally Euclidean, and we show that the local Euclidean estimate matches that of traditional bundle adjustment. Our system operates online in realtime using stereo data, with fast appearance-based loop closure detection. We show results on over 850,000 images that indicate the accuracy and scalability of the approach, and process over 330 {GB} of image data into a relative map covering 142 km of Southern England. To demonstrate a baseline sufficiency for navigation, we show that it is possible to find shortest paths in the relative maps we build, in terms of both time and distance. Query images from the web of popular landmarks around London, such as the London Eye or Trafalgar Square, are matched to the relative map to provide route planning goals.},

One of the main advantages with this approach is that linear constraints are easily incorporated by letting the corresponding diagonal elements in M become zero. Householder reflections are generalized to M-invariant reflections, and an algorithm for solving the constrained and weighted linear least squares problem is described. The system equations (or the augmented system equations) are used to derive condition numbers, and the connection between these condition numbers and the rounding error in the solution is investigated.},

We show that both of these can be formulated as special cases of a generalized localization problem. In the standard localization problem, the aim is to determine the pose of some object (usually a mobile robot) relative to a global coordinate system. In our generalized version, the aim is to determine the pose of all elements in a network (both fixed and mobile) relative to an arbitrary global coordinate system. We have developed a physically inspired 'mesh-based' formalism for solving such problems. This paper outlines the formalism, and describes its application to the concrete tasks of multirobot mapping and calibration of a distributed sensor network. The paper presents experimental results for both tasks obtained using a set of Pioneer mobile robots equipped with scanning laser range-finders.},

This paper shows that a least-squares {PnL} problem can be transformed into a quadratic equation system that has the same form as the minimal problem. This leads to a unified solution for the minimal and least-squares {PnL} problems. We adopt the Gram-Schmidt process and a novel hidden variable polynomial solver to increase the numerical stability of our algorithm. Experimental results show that our algorithm is more accurate and robust than the state-of-the-art least-squares algorithms [1], [2], [3], [4] and is significantly faster.

	abstract = {Simultaneous localization and mapping ({SLAM}) is the process of constructing a global model of an environment from local observations of it; this is a foundational capability for mobile robots, supporting such core functions as planning, navigation, and control. This article reviews recent progress in {SLAM}, focusing on advances in the expressive capacity of the environmental models used in {SLAM} systems (representation) and the performance of the algorithms used to estimate these models from data (inference). A prominent theme of recent {SLAM} research is the pursuit of environmental representations (including learned representations) that go beyond the classical attributes of geometry and appearance to model properties such as hierarchical organization, affordance, dynamics, and semantics; these advances equip autonomous agents with a more comprehensive understanding of the world, enabling more versatile and intelligent operation. A second major theme is a revitalized interest in the mathematical properties of the {SLAM} estimation problem itself (including its computational and information-theoretic performance limits); this work has led to the development of novel classes of certifiable and robust inference methods that dramatically improve the reliability of {SLAM} systems in real-world operation. We survey these advances with an emphasis on their ramifications for achieving robust, long-duration autonomy, and conclude with a discussion of open challenges and a perspective on future research directions.

Appl., 26 (2005), pp. 272–284] studies a closely related problem and calls it the semideﬁnite least-squares problem. In this paper we formulate a dual problem that has no matrix inequality or matrix variables, and a number of (scalar) variables equal to the number of equality and inequality constraints in the original least-squares covariance adjustment problem. This dual problem allows us to solve far larger least-squares covariance adjustment problems than would be possible using standard methods. Assuming a modest number of constraints, problems with n = 1000 are readily solved by the dual method. The dual method coincides with the dual method proposed by Malick when there are no inequality constraints and can be obtained as an extension of his dual method when there are inequality constraints. Using the dual problem, we show that in many cases the optimal solution is a low rank update of the original matrix. When the original matrix has structure, such as sparsity, this observation allows us to solve very large least-squares covariance adjustment problems.},

	abstract = {Large-scale {SLAM} demands for scalable techniques in which the computational burden and the memory consumption is shared among many processing units. While recent literature offers competitive approaches for scalable mapping, these usually involve approximations to preserve sparsity of the resulting subproblems. We present an approach to scalable {SLAM} that is exactly sparse. The main insight is that rather than eliminating variables (which induces dense cliques), we split the separators connecting subgraphs. Then, we enforce consistency of the separators in different subgraphs using hard constraints. The resulting constrained optimization problem can be solved in a decentralized manner using the multiblock Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers ({ADMM}). Our framework is appealing since (i) it preserves the sparsity structure of the original problem, (ii) it has a straightforward implementation, (iii) it allows to easily trade-off between computation time and accuracy. While our approach is currently slower than competitors, it is more accurate than other memory efﬁcient alternatives. Moreover, we believe that the proposed framework can be of interest on its own as it draws connections with recent literature on decentralized optimization.},

By enabling robots to optimize their local trajectory estimates without synchronization, {ASAPP} offers resiliency against communication delays and alleviates the need to wait for stragglers in the network. Furthermore, {ASAPP} can be applied on the rank-restricted relaxations of {PGO}, a crucial class of non-convex Riemannian optimization problems that underlies recent breakthroughs on globally optimal {PGO}. Under bounded delay, we establish the global first-order convergence of {ASAPP} using a sufficiently small stepsize. The derived stepsize depends on the worst-case delay and inherent problem sparsity, and furthermore matches known result for synchronous algorithms when there is no delay. Numerical evaluations on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate favorable performance compared to state-of-the-art synchronous approach, and show {ASAPP}'s resilience against a wide range of delays in practice.},

However, recent research shows that some simple iterative methods based on linearization can sometimes provide surprisingly good solutions to {SLAM} without being trapped into a local minimum. This demonstrates that hidden structure exists in the {SLAM} problem that is yet to be understood. In this paper, we first analyze how far {SLAM} is from a convex optimization problem. Then we show that by properly choosing the state vector, {SLAM} problem can be formulated as a nonlinear least squares problem with many quadratic terms in the objective function, thus it is clearer how far {SLAM} is from a linear least squares problem. Furthermore, we explain that how the map joining approaches reduce the nonlinearity/nonconvexity of the {SLAM} problem.},

By introducing new variables and some approximations, the {LS} pose {SLAM} problem can be formulated as a quadratically constrained quadratic programming ({QCQP}) problem. The {QCQP} formulation can then be relaxed into a semi-definite programming ({SDP}) problem which is convex. Unique solution to the convex {SDP} problem can be obtained without initial state estimate and can be used to construct a candidate solution to the original {LS} pose {SLAM} problem. Simulation datasets and the Intel Research Lab dataset have been used to demonstrate that when the relative pose information contain noises with reasonable level, the candidate solution obtained through the relaxation is very close to the optimal solution to the {LS} {SLAM} problem. Thus in practice, the candidate solution can serve as either an approximate solution or a good initial guess for a local optimization algorithm to obtain the optimal solution to the {LS} pose {SLAM} problem.},

Linear shrinkage is simpler to understand, to derive, and to implement.

	abstract = {High dimensional covariance estimation is known to be a diﬃcult problem, has many applications and is of current interest to the larger statistical community. We consider the problem of estimating the covariance matrix of a multivariate normal distribution in the “large p small n” setting. Several approaches to high dimensional covariance estimation have been proposed in the literature. In many applications, the covariance matrix estimate is required to be not only invertible but also well-conditioned. Although many estimators attempt to do this, none of them address this problem directly. In this paper, we propose a maximum likelihood approach with an explicit constraint on the condition number to try and obtain a well-conditioned estimator. We demonstrate that the proposed estimation approach is computationally eﬃcient, can be interpreted as a type of nonlinear shrinkage estimator, and has a natural Bayesian interpretation. We fully investigate the theoretical properties of the proposed estimator and proceed to develop an approach that adaptively determines the level of regularization that is required. Finally we investigate the performance of the estimator in simulated and real-life examples and demonstrate that it has good risk properties and can serve as a competitive procedure especially when the sample size is small and when a well-conditioned estimator is required.},

The Fisher Information Matrix ({FIM}) is derived for several different parameterizations of Gaussians. Careful attention is paid to the symmetric nature of the covariance matrix when calculating derivatives. We show that there are some advantages to choosing a parameterization comprising the mean and inverse covariance matrix and provide a simple {NGD} update that accounts for the symmetric (and sparse) nature of the inverse covariance matrix.},

	abstract = {In order to tackle the challenge of unfavorable weather conditions such as rain and snow, radar is being revisited as a parallel sensing modality to vision and lidar. Recent works have made tremendous progress in applying spinning radar to odometry and place recognition. However, these works have so far ignored the impact of motion distortion and Doppler effects on spinning-radar-based navigation, which may be significant in the self-driving car domain where speeds can be high. In this work, we demonstrate the effect of these distortions on radar odometry using the Oxford Radar {RobotCar} Dataset and metric localization using our own data-taking platform. We revisit a lightweight estimator that can recover the motion between a pair of radar scans while accounting for both effects. Our conclusion is that both motion distortion and the Doppler effect are significant in different aspects of spinning radar navigation, with the former more prominent than the latter.

The perception system is generally divided into many subsystems responsible for tasks such as self-driving-car localization, static obstacles mapping, moving obstacles detection and tracking, road mapping, traffic signalization detection and recognition, among others. The decision-making system is commonly partitioned as well into many subsystems responsible for tasks such as route planning, path planning, behavior selection, motion planning, and control. In this survey, we present the typical architecture of the autonomy system of self-driving cars. We also review research on relevant methods for perception and decision making.

	abstract = {Self-driving cars are gradually being introduced in the United States and in several Member States of the European Union. Policymakers will thus have to make important choices regarding the application of the law. One important aspect relates to the question who should be held liable for the damage caused by such vehicles. Arguably, product liability schemes will gain importance considering that the driver's fault as a cause of damage will become less likely with the increase of autonomous systems. The application of existing product liability legislation, however, is not always straightforward. Without a proper and effective liability framework, other legal or policy initiatives concerning technical and safety matters related to self-driving cars might be in vain. The article illustrates this conclusion by analysing the limitation periods for filing a claim included in the European Union Product Liability Directive, which are inherently incompatible with the concept of autonomous vehicles. On a micro-level, we argue that every aspect of the Directive should be carefully considered in the light of the autonomisation of our society. On the macro-level, we believe that ongoing technological evolutions might be the perfect moment to bring the European Union closer to its citizens.},

	abstract = {Event cameras are bioinspired vision sensors that output pixel-level brightness changes instead of standard intensity frames. These cameras do not suffer from motion blur and have a very high dynamic range, which enables them to provide reliable visual information during high-speed motions or in scenes characterized by high dynamic range. However, event cameras output only little information when the amount of motion is limited, such as in the case of almost still motion. Conversely, standard cameras provide instant and rich information about the environment most of the time (in low-speed and good lighting scenarios), but they fail severely in case of fast motions, or difficult lighting such as high dynamic range or low light scenes. In this letter, we present the first state estimation pipeline that leverages the complementary advantages of these two sensors by fusing in a tightly coupled manner events, standard frames, and inertial measurements. We show on the publicly available Event Camera Dataset that our hybrid pipeline leads to an accuracy improvement of 130\% over event-only pipelines, and 85\% over standard-frames-only visual-inertial systems, while still being computationally tractable. Furthermore, we use our pipeline to demonstrate-to the best of our knowledge-the first autonomous quadrotor flight using an event camera for state estimation, unlocking flight scenarios that were not reachable with traditional visual-inertial odometry, such as low-light environments and high dynamic range scenes.

	abstract = {We present {EVO}, an event-based visual odometry algorithm. Our algorithm successfully leverages the outstanding properties of event cameras to track fast camera motions while recovering a semidense three-dimensional (3-D) map of the environment. The implementation runs in real time on a standard {CPU} and outputs up to several hundred pose estimates per second. Due to the nature of event cameras, our algorithm is unaffected by motion blur and operates very well in challenging, high dynamic range conditions with strong illumination changes. To achieve this, we combine a novel, event-based tracking approach based on image-to-model alignment with a recent event-based 3-D reconstruction algorithm in a parallel fashion. Additionally, we show that the output of our pipeline can be used to reconstruct intensity images from the binary event stream, though our algorithm does not require such intensity information. We believe that this work makes significant progress in simultaneous localization and mapping by unlocking the potential of event cameras. This allows us to tackle challenging scenarios that are currently inaccessible to standard cameras.},

The construction relies on an invariant frame (a classical notion) and on an invariant output-error, a less standard notion precisely defined here. Using the theory we build three non-linear observers for three examples of engineering interest: a non-holonomic car, a chemical reactor, and an inertial navigation system. For each example, the design is based on physical symmetries and the convergence analysis relies on the use of invariant state-errors, a symmetry-preserving way to define the estimation error.},

	abstract = {We propose a method for sensor array self-localization using a set of sources at unknown locations. The sources produce signals whose times of arrival are registered at the sensors. We look at the general case where neither the emission times of the sources nor the reference time frames of the receivers are known. Unlike previous work, our method directly recovers the array geometry, instead of first estimating the timing information. The key component is a new loss function which is insensitive to the unknown timings. We cast the problem as a minimization of a non-convex functional of the Euclidean distance matrix of microphones and sources subject to certain non-convex constraints. After convexification, we obtain a semidefinite relaxation which gives an approximate solution; subsequent refinement on the proposed loss via the Levenberg-Marquardt scheme gives the final locations. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of reconstruction accuracy, speed, and the ability to work with a small number of sources and receivers. It can also handle missing measurements and exploit prior geometric and temporal knowledge, for example if either the receiver offsets or the emission times are known, or if the array contains compact subarrays with known geometry.},

	abstract = {Simultaneous Localization and Mapping ({SLAM}) has found an increasing utilization lately, such as self-driving cars, robot navigation, 3D mapping, virtual reality ({VR}) and augmented reality ({AR}), etc., empowering both industry and daily life. Although the state-of-the-art algorithms where developers have spared no effort are source of intelligence, it is the datasets that dedicate behind and raise us higher. The employment of datasets is essentially a kind of simulation but profits many aspects – capacity of drilling algorithm hourly, exemption of costly hardware and ground truth system, and equitable benchmark for evaluation. However, as a branch of great significance, still the datasets have not drawn wide attention nor been reviewed thoroughly. Hence in this article, we strive to give a comprehensive and open access review of {SLAM} related datasets and evaluation, which are scarcely surveyed while highly demanded by researchers and engineers, looking forward to serving as not only a dictionary but also a development proposal. The paper starts with the methodology of dataset collection, and a taxonomy of {SLAM} related tasks. Then followed with the main portion – comprehensively survey the existing {SLAM} related datasets by category with our considerate introductions and insights. Furthermore, we talk about the evaluation criteria, which are necessary to quantify the algorithm performance on the dataset and inspect the defects. At the end, we summarize the weakness of datasets and evaluation – which could well result in the weakness of topical algorithms – to promote bridging the gap fundamentally.},

A multilayered experience map relaxation algorithm is used to correct cumulative errors in path integration after loop closure.

Diﬀerent from existing {RatSLAM} system which only uses a simple vector to represent features of visual image, in this paper, we employ an eﬃcient and very fast descriptor method, called {ORB}, to extract features from {RGB} images. Experiments show that these features are suitable to recognize the sequences of familiar visual scenes. Thus, while loop closure errors are detected, the descriptive features will help to modify the pose estimation by driving loop closure and localization in a map correction algorithm.

In this paper, we present {VINS}-Mono: a robust and versatile monocular visual-inertial state estimator. Our approach starts with a robust procedure for estimator initialization. A tightly coupled, nonlinear optimization-based method is used to obtain highly accurate visual-inertial odometry by fusing preintegrated {IMU} measurements and feature observations. A loop detection module, in combination with our tightly coupled formulation, enables relocalization with minimum computation. We additionally perform 4-{DOF} pose graph optimization to enforce the global consistency. Furthermore, the proposed system can reuse a map by saving and loading it in an efficient way. The current and previous maps can be merged together by the global pose graph optimization. We validate the performance of our system on public datasets and real-world experiments and compare against other state-of-the-art algorithms. We also perform an onboard closed-loop autonomous flight on the microaerial-vehicle platform and port the algorithm to an {iOS}-based demonstration.

	abstract = {We propose {ORBSLAM}-Atlas, a system able to handle an unlimited number of disconnected sub-maps, that includes a robust map merging algorithm able to detect sub-maps with common regions and seamlessly fuse them. The outstanding robustness and accuracy of {ORBSLAM} are due to its ability to detect wide-baseline matches between keyframes, and to exploit them by means of non-linear optimization, however it only can handle a single map. {ORBSLAM}-Atlas brings the wide-baseline matching detection and exploitation to the multiple map arena. The result is a {SLAM} system significantly more general and robust, able to perform multi-session mapping. If tracking is lost during exploration, instead of freezing the map, a new sub-map is launched, and it can be fused with the previous map when common parts are visited. Our criteria to declare the camera lost contrast with previous approaches that simply count the number of tracked points, we propose to discard also inaccurately estimated camera poses due to bad geometrical conditioning. As a result, the map is split into more accurate sub-maps, that are eventually merged in a more accurate global map, thanks to the multi-mapping capabilities. We provide extensive experimental validation in the {EuRoC} datasets, where {ORBSLAM}-Atlas obtains accurate monocular and stereo results in the difficult sequences where {ORBSLAM} failed. We also build global maps after multiple sessions in the same room, obtaining the best results to date, between 2 and 3 times more accurate than competing multi-map approaches. We also show the robustness and capability of our system to deal with dynamic scenes, quantitatively in the {EuRoC} datasets and qualitatively in a densely populated corridor where camera occlusions and tracking losses are frequent.},

	abstract = {Aiming at localizing persons in industrial sites is a major concern towards the development of the factory of the future. During the last years, developments have been made in several active research domains targeting the localization problem, among which the vision-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping paradigm. This has led to the development of multiple algorithms in this field such as {ORB}-{SLAM}2 known to be the most complete method as it incorporates the majority of the state-of-the-art techniques. Recently, new commercial and low-cost systems have also emerged in the market that can estimate the 6-{DOF} motion. In particular, we refer here to the Intel Realsense T265, a standalone 6-{DOF} tracking sensor that runs a visual-inertial {SLAM} algorithm and that accurately estimates the 6-{DOF} motion as claimed by the Intel company. In this paper, we present an evaluation of the Intel T265 tracking camera by comparing its localization performances to the {ORB}-{SLAM}2 algorithm. This benchmarking fits within a specific use-case: the person localization in an industrial site. The experiments have been conducted in a platform equipped with a {VICON} motion capture system, which physical structure is similar to a one that we could find in an industrial site. The Vicon system is made of fifteen high-speedtracking cameras (100 Hz) which provides highly accurate poses that were used as ground truth reference. The sequences have been recorded using both an Intel {RealSense} D435 camera to use its stereo images with {ORB}-{SLAM}2 and the Intel {RealSense} T265. The two sets of timestamped poses ({VICON} and the ones provided by the cameras) were aligned then calibrated using the point set registration method. The Absolute Trajectory Error, the Relative Trajectory Error and the Euclidian Distance Error metrics were employed to benchmark the localization accuracy from {ORB}-{SLAM}2 and T265. The results show a competitive accuracy of both systems for a handheld camera in an indoor industrial environment with a better reliability with the T265 Tracking system.},

Unfortunately many researchers and engineers struggle with the formulation of such problems and often fall back to suboptimal solutions. The existence of many different conventions further complicates this issue, especially when interfacing multiple differing implementations. This document discusses an alternative approach which makes use of a more abstract notion of 3D orientations. The relative orientation between two coordinate systems is primarily identified by the coordinate mapping it induces. This is combined with the standard exponential map in order to introduce representation-independent and minimal differentials, which are very convenient in optimization based methods.},

To guarantee real-time performance, we estimate the state within the framework of error-state iterated Kalman-ﬁlter, and further improve the overall precision with our factor graph optimization. Taking advantage of measurement from all individual sensors, our algorithm is robust enough to various visual failure, {LiDAR}-degenerated scenarios, and is able to run in real-time on an on-board computation platform, as shown by extensive experiments conducted in indoor, outdoor, and mixed environment of different scale. Moreover, the results show that our proposed framework can improve the accuracy of state-of-the-art {LiDAR}-inertial or visual-inertial odometry.

The novelty in the method is a line search procedure for selecting suitable step sizes. The line search obviates the need for estimating the norm of the constraint matrix and the strong convexity constant of the Bregman kernel. As an application, we discuss the centering problem in large-scale semideﬁnite programming with sparse coeﬃcient matrices. The logarithmic barrier function for the cone of positive semideﬁnite completable sparse matrices is used as the distance-generating kernel. For this distance, the complexity of evaluating the Bregman proximal operator is shown to be roughly proportional to the cost of a sparse Cholesky factorization. This is much cheaper than the standard proximal operator with Euclidean distances, which requires an eigenvalue decomposition.},

For many distributions it is possible to create low-variance gradient estimators by utilizing a ‘reparameterization trick’. Due to the absence of a general reparameterization trick, much research has recently been devoted to extend the number of reparameterizable distributional families. Unfortunately, this research has primarily focused on distributions deﬁned in Euclidean space, ruling out the usage of one of the most inﬂuential class of spaces with non-trivial topologies: Lie groups. In this work we deﬁne a general framework to create reparameterizable densities on arbitrary Lie groups, and provide a detailed practitioners guide to further the ease of usage. We demonstrate how to create complex and multimodal distributions on the well known oriented group of 3D rotations, {SO}(3), using normalizing ﬂows. Our experiments on applying such distributions in a Bayesian setting for pose estimation on objects with discrete and continuous symmetries, showcase their necessity in achieving realistic uncertainty estimates.},

In our first algorithm, to guarantee filter consistency, we account for unknown interagent correlations via an upper bound on the joint covariance matrix of the agents. In the second method, we use an optimization framework to estimate the unknown interagent cross-covariance matrix. In our algorithms, each agent localizes itself in a global coordinate frame using a local filter driven by local dead reckoning and occasional absolute measurement updates, and opportunistically corrects its pose estimate whenever it can obtain relative measurements with respect to other mobile agents. To process any relative measurement, only the agent that has taken the measurement and the agent the measurement is taken from need to communicate with each other. Consequently, our algorithms are decentralized algorithms that do not impose restrictive network-wide connectivity condition. Moreover, we make no assumptions about the type of agents or relative measurements. We demonstrate our algorithms in simulation and a robotic experiment.},

Inversion-based feedforward approaches are commonly used for improving tracking performance; however, these approaches are not directly applicable to non-minimum phase systems due to their inherent instability. In order to resolve the instability issue, existing methods have assumed that the system model is known and used pre-actuation or inverse approximation techniques. In this work, we propose an approach for learning a stable, approximate inverse of a non-minimum phase baseline system directly from its input-output data. Through theoretical discussions, simulations, and experiments on two different platforms, we show the stability of our proposed approach and its effectiveness for high-accuracy, impromptu tracking. Our approach also shows that including more information in the training, as is commonly assumed to be useful, does not lead to better performance but may trigger instability and impact the effectiveness of the overall approach.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09479},
	shorttitle = {{PL}-{SLAM}},
	abstract = {Traditional approaches to stereo visual {SLAM} rely on point features to estimate the camera trajectory and build a map of the environment. In lowtextured environments, though, it is often diﬃcult to ﬁnd a suﬃcient number of reliable point features and, as a consequence, the performance of such algorithms degrades. This paper proposes {PL}-{SLAM}, a stereo visual {SLAM} system that combines both points and line segments to work robustly in a wider variety of scenarios, particularly in those where point features are scarce or not well-distributed in the image. {PLSLAM} leverages both points and segments at all the instances of the process: visual odometry, keyframe selection, bundle adjustment, etc. We contribute also with a loop closure procedure through a novel bag-ofwords approach that exploits the combined descriptive power of the two kinds of features. Additionally, the resulting map is richer and more diverse in 3D elements, which can be exploited to infer valuable, highlevel scene structures like planes, empty spaces, ground plane, etc. (not addressed in this work). Our proposal has been tested with several popular datasets (such as {KITTI} and {EuRoC}), and is compared to state of the art methods like {ORB}-{SLAM}, revealing a more robust performance in most of the experiments, while still running in real-time. An open source version of the {PL}-{SLAM} C++ code will be released for the beneﬁt of the community.},

For inference problems of this type, each input datum gives rise to a summand in the objective function, and therefore performing online inference corresponds to solving a sequence of sparse nonlinear least-squares minimization problems in which additional summands are added to the objective function over time. In this paper, we present Robust Incremental least-Squares Estimation ({RISE}), an incrementalized version of the Powell's Dog-Leg numerical optimization method suitable for use in online sequential sparse least-squares minimization. As a trust-region method, {RISE} is naturally robust to objective function nonlinearity and numerical ill-conditioning and is provably globally convergent for a broad class of inferential cost functions (twice-continuously differentiable functions with bounded sublevel sets). Consequently, {RISE} maintains the speed of current state-of-the-art online sparse least-squares methods while providing superior reliability.},

While direct methods, popular in the literature, exhibit quadratic convergence and can be quite efficient for sparse problems, they typically require a lot of storage and efficient elimination orderings to be found. In contrast, iterative optimization methods only require access to the gradient and have a small memory footprint, but can suffer from poor convergence. Our new method, subgraph preconditioning, is obtained by re-interpreting the method of conjugate gradients in terms of the graphical model representation of the {SLAM} problem. The main idea is to combine the advantages of direct and iterative methods, by identifying a sub-problem that can be easily solved using direct methods, and solving for the remaining part using {PCG}. The easy sub-problems correspond to a spanning tree, a planar subgraph, or any other substructure that can be efficiently solved. As such, our approach provides new insights into the performance of state of the art iterative {SLAM} methods based on re-parameterized stochastic gradient descent. The efficiency of our new algorithm is illustrated on large datasets, both simulated and real.},

The robustness of this ﬁlter allows for techniques with high noise potential like ultra-wideband localization to be used for a wider variety of applications like autonomous metal structure inspection. The ﬁlter is derived and its performance is evaluated by testing it on two different manifolds: a cylindrical one and a bivariate b-spline representation of a real vessel surface, showing its ﬂexibility to being used on different types of surfaces. Its comparison with a standard {EKF} that uses virtual, noise-free measurements as manifold constraints proves that it outperforms standard approaches in consistency and accuracy. Further, an experiment using a real magnetic crawler robot on a curved metal surface with ultra-wideband localization shows that the proposed approach is viable in the real world application of autonomous metal structure inspection.},

Bundle adjustment involves the formulation of a large scale, yet sparse minimization problem, which is traditionally solved using a sparse variant of the {LevenbergMarquardt} optimization algorithm that avoids storing and operating on zero entries. This paper argues that considerable computational beneﬁts can be gained by substituting the sparse Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm in the implementation of bundle adjustment with a sparse variant of Powell’s dog leg non-linear least squares technique.

	abstract = {Many online inference problems in robotics and {AI} are characterized by probability distributions whose factor graph representations are sparse. While there do exist some computationally efﬁcient algorithms (e.g. incremental smoothing and mapping ({iSAM}) or Robust Incremental least-Squares Estimation ({RISE})) for performing online incremental maximum likelihood estimation over these models, they generally require that the distribution of interest factors as a product of Gaussians, a rather restrictive assumption. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of performing efﬁcient incremental online estimation over sparse factor graphs in the non-Gaussian case. Our main result is a method that generalizes {iSAM} and {RISE} by removing the assumption of Gaussian factors, thereby signiﬁcantly expanding the class of distributions to which these algorithms can be applied. The generalization is achieved by means of a simple algebraic reduction that under relatively mild conditions (boundedness of each of the factors in the distribution of interest) enables an instance of the general maximum likelihood estimation problem to be reduced to an equivalent instance of least-squares minimization that can be solved efﬁciently online by application of {iSAM} or {RISE}. Through this construction we obtain robust, computationally efﬁcient, and mathematically correct incremental online maximum likelihood estimators for non-Gaussian distributions over sparse factor graphs.},

We also provide estimates for the basin of attraction of the maximum likelihood solution and results on the uniqueness of such solution. The results confirm observations of related work and explain why common Simultaneous Localization and Mapping ({SLAM}) instances are so well-behaved in terms of convergence. Moreover, as a by-product of the derivation, we present different techniques that can enlarge the convergence radius a-priori (i.e., during robot operation) or a-posteriori (i.e., given the data).

The information-theoretic cost function proposed in this paper consist of two information gain terms, one for detection and localization of objects and the other for sequential classification of the detected objects. We present a novel closed-form representation for the cost function, derived from the definition of mutual information. We evaluate three different policies for choosing the next sensing action: lawn mower, greedy, and non-greedy. For these three policies, we compare the results from our information-theoretic cost functions to the results of other information-theoretic inspired cost functions. Our simulation results show that search efficiency is greater using the proposed cost functions compared to those of the other methods.},

	abstract = {This book presents the fundamentals of sparse matrix algorithms, from theory to algorithms and data structures to working code. The focus is on direct methods for solving systems of linear equations; iterative methods and solvers for eigenvalue problems are beyond the scope of this book. The goal is to impart a working knowledge of the underlying theory and practice of sparse matrix algorithms, so that you will have the foundation to understand more complex (but faster) algorithms. Methods that operate on dense submatrices of a larger sparse matrix (multifrontal and supernodal methods) are much faster, but a complete sparse matrix package based on these methods can be tens of thousands of lines long. The sparse {LU}, Cholesky, and {QR} factorization codes in {MATLAB}®, for example, total about 100,000 lines of code. Trying to understand the sparse matrix technique by starting with such huge codes is a daunting task. To overcome this obstacle, a sparse matrix package, {CSparse}, has been written specifically for this book. It can solve Ax = b when A is unsymmetric, symmetric positive definite, or rectangular, using about 2,200 lines of code. Although simple and concise, it is based on recently developed methods and theory. All of {CSparse} is printed in this book. Take your time to read and understand these codes; do not gloss over them. You will find them much easier to comprehend and learn from than their larger (yet faster) cousins. The larger packages you may use in practice are based on much of the theory and some of the algorithms presented more concisely and simply in {CSparse}. For example, the {MATLAB} statement x=A{\textbackslash}b relies on the theory and algorithms from almost every section of this book. Parallel sparse matrix algorithms are excluded, yet they too rely on the theory discussed here.},

In this paper, we analyse the {VIO} problem from a geometric perspective and propose a novel formulation on a smooth quotient manifold where the equivalence relationship is the well-known invariance of {VIO} to choice of reference frame. We propose a novel Lie group that acts transitively on this manifold and is compatible with the visual measurements. This structure allows for the application of Equivariant Filter ({EqF}) design leading to a novel filter for the {VIO} problem. Combined with a very simple vision processing front-end, the proposed filter demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the {EuRoC} dataset compared to other {EKF}-based {VIO} algorithms.},

Coupled with this set of analytic advances has been the vast increase in computational power available both for the simulation of nonlinear systems as well as for the implementation in real time of sophisticated, real-time nonlinear control laws. Thus, technological advances have bolstered the impact of analytic advances and produced a tremendous variety of new problems and applications which are nonlinear in an essential way. This book lays out in a concise mathematical framework the tools and methods of analysis which underlie this diversity of applications.

A single incorrect decision that is not detected and reconsidered can corrupt the environment model that the robot is trying to build and maintain. This work describes a consensus-based approach to robust place recognition over time, that takes into account all the available information to detect and remove past incorrect loop closures. The main novelties of our work are: (1) the ability of realizing that, in light of new evidence, an incorrect past loop closing decision has been made; the incorrect information can be removed thus recovering the correct estimation with a novel algorithm; (2) extending our proposal to incremental operation; and (3) handling multi-session, spatially related or unrelated scenarios in a unified manner. We demonstrate our proposal, the {RRR} algorithm, on different odometry systems, e.g. visual or laser, using different front-end loop-closing techniques. For our experiments we use the efficient graph optimization framework g2o as back-end. We back our claims up with several experiments carried out on real data, in single and multi-session experiments showing better results than those obtained by state-of-the-art methods, comparisons against whom are also presented.},

In this paper, we survey recent approaches for addressing this challenge including (i) approaches for exploiting structure (e.g., sparsity and symmetry) in a problem, (ii) approaches that produce low-rank approximate solutions to semidefinite programs, (iii) more scalable algorithms that rely on augmented Lagrangian techniques and the alternating direction method of multipliers, and (iv) approaches that trade off scalability with conservatism (e.g., by approximating semidefinite programs with linear and second-order cone programs). For each class of approaches we provide a high-level exposition, an entry-point to the corresponding literature, and examples drawn from machine learning, control, or robotics. We also present a list of software packages that implement many of the techniques discussed in the paper. Our hope is that this paper will serve as a gateway to the rich and exciting literature on scalable semidefinite programming for both theorists and practitioners.},

It is demonstrated that more than one minimum exists only when the observation and odometry data are extremely inconsistent with each other.

In this paper, we analyze the structure of the nonlinearities in the 2D {SLAM} problem formulated as the optimizing of a pose graph. First, we prove that ﬁnding the optimal conﬁguration of a very basic pose graph with 3 nodes (poses) and 3 edges (relative pose constraints) with spherical covariance matrices, which can be formulated as a six dimensional least squares optimization problem, is equivalent to solving a one dimensional optimization problem. Then we show that the same result can be extended to the optimizing of a pose graph with “two anchor nodes” where every edge is connecting to one of the two anchor nodes. Furthermore, we prove that the global minimum of the resulting one dimensional optimization problem must belong to a certain interval and there are at most 3 minima in that interval. Thus the globally optimal pose conﬁguration of the pose graph can be obtained very easily through the bisection method and closed-form formulas.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07309},
	abstract = {Robotics and computer vision problems commonly require handling rigid-body motions comprising translation and rotation - together referred to as pose. In some situations, a vectorial parameterization of pose can be useful, where elements of a vector space are surjectively mapped to a matrix Lie group. For example, these vectorial representations can be employed for optimization as well as uncertainty representation on groups. The most common mapping is the matrix exponential, which maps elements of a Lie algebra onto the associated Lie group. However, this choice is not unique. It has been previously shown how to characterize all such vectorial parameterizations for {SO}(3), the group of rotations. We extend this result to {SE}(3), the group of poses (translation and rotation), showing how to build a family of mappings that includes the matrix exponential as well as the Cayley transformation. While our main contribution is the theory, we also demonstrate three different applications of the proposed pose mappings: (i) pose interpolation, (ii) pose servoing control, and (iii) pose estimation in a pointcloud alignment problem. In the pointcloud alignment problem our results lead to a new algorithm based on the Cayley transformation, which we call {CayPer}.},

The proposed parallax angle feature parametrization in {BA} ({ParallaxBA}) avoids both of the above problems leading to better convergence properties and more accurate motion and structure estimates. Simulation and experimental datasets are used to demonstrate the impact of different feature parametrizations on {BA}, and the improved convergence, efficiency and accuracy of the proposed {ParallaxBA} algorithm when compared with some existing {BA} packages such as {SBA}, {sSBA} and g2o.

	abstract = {We address the problem of self-supervised learning for predicting the shape of supporting terrain (i.e. the terrain which will provide rigid support for the robot during its traversal) from sparse input measurements. The learning method exploits two types of ground-truth labels: dense 2.5D maps and robot poses, both estimated by a usual {SLAM} procedure from offline recorded measurements. We show that robot poses are required because straightforward supervised learning from the 3D maps only suffers from: (i) exaggerated height of the supporting terrain caused by terrain flexibility (vegetation, shallow water, snow or sand) and (ii) missing or noisy measurements caused by high spectral absorbance or non-Lambertian reflectance of the measured surface. We address the learning from robot poses by introducing a novel {KKT}-loss, which emerges as the distance from necessary Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions for constrained local optima of a simplified first-principle model of the robot-terrain interaction. We experimentally verify that the proposed weakly supervised learning from ground-truth robot poses boosts the accuracy of predicted support heightmaps and increases the accuracy of estimated robot poses. All experiments are conducted on a dataset captured by a real platform. Both the dataset and codes which replicates experiments in the paper are made publicly available as a part of the submission.},

During a learning phase, the rover is piloted along a route capturing stereo images. The images are processed into a manifold map of topologically-connected submaps that may be used for localization during an autonomous repeat traverse. Path following in non-planar terrain is handled by moving from localization in three dimensions, to path following in two dimensions using a local ground plane associated with each submap. The use of small submaps decouples the computational complexity of route repeating from the length of the path. We validate the algorithm by demonstrating its performance on a difficult three-dimensional route. Using this technique, a rover may autonomously traverse a multi-kilometer route in unstructured, three-dimensional terrain, without an accurate global reconstruction.},

We achieve this by exploiting the underlying sparsity and constraints of our formulation to efficiently compute the Gauss-Newton direction. We show that this computation scales linearly with the number of joints of a complex 3D human model, in contrast to prior work where it scales cubically due to their dense unconstrained formulation. Based on our optimization method, we present a real-time motion capture framework that estimates 3D human poses and shapes from a single image at over 30 {FPS}. In benchmarks against state-of-the-art methods on multiple public datasets, our frame-work outperforms other optimization methods and achieves competitive accuracy against regression methods.},

One of the novel methods, the Invariant Extended Kalman Filter ({InEKF}) extends the Extended Kalman Filter ({EKF}) by leveraging the fact that some error dynamics defined on matrix Lie Groups satisfy a log-linear differential equation. Utilization of these observations result in linearization with minimal approximation error, no dependence on current state estimates, and excellent convergence and accuracy properties. In this paper we show that the primary sensors used for underwater localization, inertial measurement units ({IMUs}) and doppler velocity logs ({DVLs}) meet the requirements of the {InEKF}. Furthermore, we show that singleton measurements, such as depth, can also be used in the {InEKF} update with minor modifications, thus expanding the set of measurements usable in an {InEKF}. We compare convergence, accuracy and timing results of the {InEKF} to a quaternion-based {EKF} using a Monte Carlo simulation and show notable improvements in long-term localization and much faster convergence with negligible difference in computation time.},

	abstract = {A recent line of work has shown that end-to-end optimization of Bayesian filters can be used to learn state estimators for systems whose underlying models are difficult to hand-design or tune, while retaining the core advantages of probabilistic state estimation. As an alternative approach for state estimation in these settings, we present an end-to-end approach for learning state estimators modeled as factor graph-based smoothers. By unrolling the optimizer we use for maximum a posteriori inference in these probabilistic graphical models, this method is able to learn probabilistic system models in the full context of an overall state estimator, while also taking advantage of the distinct accuracy and runtime advantages that smoothers offer over recursive filters. We study our approach using two fundamental state estimation problems, object tracking and visual odometry, where we demonstrate a significant improvement over existing baselines.

The resulting estimator is proved to be statistically as efficient as the global estimator. Moreover, it requires only one round of communication. We further conduct a shrinkage estimation based on the {DLSA} estimation using an adaptive Lasso approach. The solution can be easily obtained by using the {LARS} algorithm on the master node. It is theoretically shown that the resulting estimator possesses the oracle property and is selection consistent by using a newly designed distributed Bayesian information criterion ({DBIC}). The finite sample performance and computational efficiency are further illustrated by an extensive numerical study and an airline dataset. The airline dataset is 52 {GB} in size.

The proposed algorithm assigns each solution a dual role by logically dividing the population into political parties and constituencies, which facilitates each candidate to update its position with respect to the party leader and the constituency winner. Moreover, a novel position updating strategy called recent past-based position updating strategy ({RPPUS}) is introduced, which is the mathematical modeling of the learning behaviors of the politicians from the previous election. The proposed algorithm is benchmarked with 50 unimodal, multimodal, and fixed dimensional functions against 15 state of the art algorithms. We show through experiments that {PO} has an excellent convergence speed with good exploration capability in early iterations. Root cause of such behavior of {PO} is incorporation of {RPPUS} and logical division of the population to assign dual role to each candidate solution. Using Wilcoxon rank-sum test, {PO} demonstrates statistically significant performance over the other algorithms. The results show that {PO} outperforms all other algorithms, and consistency in performance on such a comprehensive suite of benchmark functions proves the versatility of the algorithm. Furthermore, experiments demonstrate that {PO} is invariant to function shifting and performs consistently in very high dimensional search spaces. Finally, the applicability on real-world applications is demonstrated by efficiently solving four engineering optimization problems.},

This systematization is done, mainly, by revisiting the concepts of Sigma-Representation, Unscented Transformation ({UT}), Scaled Unscented Transformation ({SUT}), {UKF}, and Square-Root Unscented Kalman Filter ({SRUKF}). Inconsistencies are related to 1) matching the order of the transformed covariance and cross-covariance matrices of both the {UT} and the {SUT}; 2) multiple {UKF} definitions; 3) issue with some reduced sets of sigma points described in the literature; 4) the conservativeness of the {SUT}; 5) the scaling effect of the {SUT} on both its transformed covariance and cross-covariance matrices; and 6) possibly ill-conditioned results in {SRUKF}'s. With the proposed systematization, the symmetric sets of sigma points in the literature are formally justified, and we are able to provide new consistent variations for {UKF}'s, such as the Scaled {SRUKF}'s and the {UKF}'s composed by the minimum number of sigma points.

The obtained algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art on the (unseen) test sequences. The obtained performances are achieved thanks to a well-chosen model, a proper loss function for orientation increments, and through the identification of key points when training with high-frequency inertial data. Our approach builds upon a neural network based on dilated convolutions, without requiring any recurrent neural network. We demonstrate how efficient our strategy is for 3D attitude estimation on the {EuRoC} and {TUM}-{VI} datasets. Interestingly, we observe our dead reckoning algorithm manages to beat top-ranked visual-inertial odometry systems in terms of attitude estimation although it does not use vision sensors. We believe this paper offers new perspectives for visual-inertial localization and constitutes a step toward more efficient learning methods involving {IMUs}.

	abstract = {A Lie group is an old mathematical abstract object dating back to the {XIX} century, when mathematician Sophus Lie laid the foundations of the theory of continuous transformation groups. As it often happens, its usage has spread over diverse areas of science and technology many years later. In robotics, we are recently experiencing an important trend in its usage, at least in the fields of estimation, and particularly in motion estimation for navigation. Yet for a vast majority of roboticians, Lie groups are highly abstract constructions and therefore difficult to understand and to use. This may be due to the fact that most of the literature on Lie theory is written by and for mathematicians and physicists, who might be more used than us to the deep abstractions this theory deals with. In estimation for robotics it is often not necessary to exploit the full capacity of the theory, and therefore an effort of selection of materials is required. In this paper, we will walk through the most basic principles of the Lie theory, with the aim of conveying clear and useful ideas, and leave a significant corpus of the Lie theory behind. Even with this mutilation, the material included here has proven to be extremely useful in modern estimation algorithms for robotics, especially in the fields of {SLAM}, visual odometry, and the like. Alongside this micro Lie theory, we provide a chapter with a few application examples, and a vast reference of formulas for the major Lie groups used in robotics, including most jacobian matrices and the way to easily manipulate them. We also present a new C++ template-only library implementing all the functionality described here.},

	abstract = {This paper derives a contact-aided inertial navigation observer for a 3D bipedal robot using the theory of invariant observer design. Aided inertial navigation is fundamentally a nonlinear observer design problem; thus, current solutions are based on approximations of the system dynamics, such as an Extended Kalman Filter ({EKF}), which uses a system’s Jacobian linearization along the current best estimate of its trajectory. On the basis of the theory of invariant observer design by Barrau and Bonnabel, and in particular, the Invariant {EKF} ({InEKF}), we show that the error dynamics of the point contact-inertial system follows a log-linear autonomous differential equation; hence, the observable state variables can be rendered convergent with a domain of attraction that is independent of the system’s trajectory. Due to the log-linear form of the error dynamics, it is not necessary to perform a nonlinear observability analysis to show that when using an Inertial Measurement Unit ({IMU}) and contact sensors, the absolute position of the robot and a rotation about the gravity vector (yaw) are unobservable. We further augment the state of the developed {InEKF} with {IMU} biases, as the online estimation of these parameters has a crucial impact on system performance. We evaluate the convergence of the proposed system with the commonly used quaternionbased {EKF} observer using a Monte-Carlo simulation. In addition, our experimental evaluation using a Cassie-series bipedal robot shows that the contact-aided {InEKF} provides better performance in comparison with the quaternion-based {EKF} as a result of exploiting symmetries present in the system dynamics.},

Existing robust {SLAM} methods assume a good initialization or an “odometry backbone” to classify inlier and outlier loop closures. In the multi-robot case, these assumptions do not always hold. This paper presents an algorithm called Pairwise Consistency Maximization ({PCM}) that estimates the largest pairwise internally consistent set of measurements. Finding the largest pairwise internally consistent set can be transformed into an instance of the maximum clique problem from graph theory, and by leveraging the associated literature it can be solved in realtime. This paper evaluates how well {PCM} approximates the combinatorial gold standard using simulated data. It also evaluates the performance of {PCM} on synthetic and real-world data sets in comparison with {DCS}, {SCGP}, and {RANSAC}, and shows that {PCM} signiﬁcantly outperforms these methods.},

	abstract = {This paper presents Kimera-Multi, the first multi-robot system that (i) is robust and capable of identifying and rejecting incorrect inter and intra-robot loop closures resulting from perceptual aliasing, (ii) is fully distributed and only relies on local (peer-to-peer) communication to achieve distributed localization and mapping, and (iii) builds a globally consistent metric-semantic 3D mesh model of the environment in real-time, where faces of the mesh are annotated with semantic labels. Kimera-Multi is implemented by a team of robots equipped with visual-inertial sensors. Each robot builds a local trajectory estimate and a local mesh using Kimera. When communication is available, robots initiate a distributed place recognition and robust pose graph optimization protocol based on a novel distributed graduated non-convexity algorithm. The proposed protocol allows the robots to improve their local trajectory estimates by leveraging inter-robot loop closures while being robust to outliers. Finally, each robot uses its improved trajectory estimate to correct the local mesh using mesh deformation techniques. We demonstrate Kimera-Multi in photo-realistic simulations, {SLAM} benchmarking datasets, and challenging outdoor datasets collected using ground robots. Both real and simulated experiments involve long trajectories (e.g., up to 800 meters per robot). The experiments show that Kimera-Multi (i) outperforms the state of the art in terms of robustness and accuracy, (ii) achieves estimation errors comparable to a centralized {SLAM} system while being fully distributed, (iii) is parsimonious in terms of communication bandwidth, (iv) produces accurate metric-semantic 3D meshes, and (v) is modular and can be also used for standard 3D reconstruction (i.e., without semantic labels) or for trajectory estimation (i.e., without reconstructing a 3D mesh).},

However, neglecting cross-covariance terms between state estimates can result in overconfident estimates, which can ultimately degrade the accuracy of the estimator. Common cascaded filtering techniques focus on the problem of modelling cross-covariances when the local estimators share a common state vector. This letter introduces a novel cascaded and decentralized filtering approach that approximates the cross-covariances when the local estimators consider distinct state vectors. The proposed estimator is validated in simulations and in experiments on a three-dimensional attitude and position estimation problem. The proposed approach is compared to a naive cascaded filtering approach that neglects cross-covariance terms, a sigma point-based Covariance Intersection filter, and a full-state filter. In both simulations and experiments, the proposed filter outperforms the naive and the Covariance Intersection filters, while performing comparatively to the full-state filter.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980302},
	abstract = {This paper presents an on-line nonlinear least squares algorithm for multi-sensor autonomous underwater vehicle ({AUV}) navigation. The approach integrates the global constraints of range to and {GPS} position of a surface vehicle or buoy communicated via acoustic modems and relative pose constraints arising from targets detected in side-scan sonar images. The approach utilizes an efficient optimization algorithm, {iSAM}, which allows for consistent on-line estimation of the entire set of trajectory constraints. The optimized trajectory can then be used to more accurately navigate the {AUV}, to extend mission duration, and to avoid {GPS} surfacing. As {iSAM} provides efficient access to the marginal covariances of previously observed features, automatic data association is greatly simplified - particularly in sparse marine environments. A key feature of our approach is its intended scalability to single surface sensor (a vehicle or buoy) broadcasting its {GPS} position and simultaneous one-way travel time range ({OWTT}) to multiple {AUVs}. We discuss why our approach is scalable as well as robust to modem transmission failure. Results are provided for an ocean experiment using a Hydroid {REMUS} 100 {AUV} co-operating with one of two craft: an autonomous surface vehicle ({ASV}) and a manned support vessel. During these experiments the ranging portion of the algorithm ran online on-board the {AUV}. Extension of the paradigm to multiple missions via the optimization of successive survey missions (and the resultant sonar mosaics) is also demonstrated.},

Data association is a critical component in point cloud registration, and can be very challenging in feature-depleted environments such as seabed. This paper presents a point cloud registration pipeline for performing loop closure correction in feature-depleted subsea environments using data collected from an optical scanner. The pipeline uses Gaussian process regression to extract keypoint sets, and a weighted network alignment algorithm to propose point correspondences. A variant of the iterative closest point ({ICP}) registration algorithm is used to perform fine alignment, with point correspondences informed by the mappings determined following the network alignment step. The developed registration pipeline is deployed with success on a challenging section of field data containing topography that cannot be resolved using conventional imaging sonar.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a system for reacquiring features of interest in a shallow-water ocean environment, using autonomous underwater vehicles ({AUVs}) equipped with low-cost sonar and navigation sensors. In performing mine countermeasures, it is critical to enable {AUVs} to navigate accurately to previously mapped objects of interest in the water column or on the seabed, for further assessment or remediation. An important aspect of the overall system design is to keep the size and cost of the reacquisition vehicle as low as possible, as it may potentially be destroyed in the reacquisition mission. This low-cost requirement prevents the use of sophisticated {AUV} navigation sensors, such as a Doppler velocity log ({DVL}) or an inertial navigation system ({INS}). Our system instead uses the Proviewer 900-{kHz} imaging sonar from Blueview Technologies, which produces forward-looking sonar ({FLS}) images at ranges up to 40 mat approximately 4 Hz. In large volumes, it is hoped that this sensor can be manufactured at low cost. Our approach uses a novel simultaneous localization and mapping ({SLAM}) algorithm that detects and tracks features in the {FLS} images to renavigate to a previously mapped target. This feature-based navigation ({FBN}) system incorporates a number of recent advances in pose graph optimization algorithms for {SLAM}. The system has undergone extensive field testing over a period of more than four years, demonstrating the potential for the use of this new approach for feature reacquisition. In this report, we review the methodologies and components of the {FBN} system, describe the system's technological features, review the performance of the system in a series of extensive in-water field tests, and highlight issues for future research.},

Together with multi-level relaxation, this is one of the most robust and efﬁcient maximum likelihood techniques published so far. In this paper, we present an extension of Olson’s algorithm. It applies a novel parameterization of the nodes in the graph that signiﬁcantly improves the performance and enables us to cope with arbitrary network topologies. The latter allows us to bound the complexity of the algorithm to the size of the mapped area and not to the length of the trajectory as it is the case with both previous approaches. We implemented our technique and compared it to multi-level relaxation and Olson’s algorithm. As we demonstrate in simulated and in real world experiments, our approach converges faster than the other approaches and yields accurate maps of the environment.},

	abstract = {In October 2003, the Geodetic Survey Division of Natural Resources Canada introduced an on-line service for {GPS} users that facilitates access to the Canadian Spatial Reference System ({CSRS}). {CSRS}-{PPP} ({CSRS} - Precise Point Positioning) allows {GPS} users in Canada (and abroad) to achieve accurate positioning by submitting {GPS} observations from a single receiver over the Internet. The resultant precision is comparable to phase-differential {GPS} without the need to access or process data collected simultaneously at a base station or to ensure that the coordinates of the base station are properly referenced. {CSRS}-{PPP} can process {GPS} observations from single or dual-frequency {GPS} receivers operating in static or kinematic mode. Depending on user equipment, receiver dynamics and duration of the observing session, this application can improve positioning results by a factor of 2 to 100 in comparison to uncorrected point positioning using broadcast {GPS} orbits. This level of improvement can often be reached with reduced cost and increased operational efficiency by eliminating the requirement for {GPS} users to acquire base-station data. The key to this {PPP} approach is the use of precise {GPS} orbit and clock products generated through international collaboration which are typically 100 times better than those contained in the {GPS} broadcast navigation message. While the service estimates user positions based on satellite orbits established in the International Terrestrial Reference Frame ({ITRF}), transformation parameters to {NAD}83 ({CSRS}) are applied internally to link the user directly to the {CSRS}. {NAD}83 ({CSRS}) is being increasingly adopted as the standard of reference for positioning in Canada. Positioning with respect to recognized standards greatly facilitates sharing and integrating geo-referenced datasets to ensure their long-term spatial compatibility at the highest precision, permitting interoperability of related applications.},

Within this scope, a geodetic point was established and {GNSS} data were logged in static mode at a measurement interval of 1 Hz. At the same time, the real-time coordinates of each measurement epoch were determined with the Trimble {CenterPoint} {RTX} positioning service using L-band geostationary satellite delivery. The collected {GNSS} data were also sent to the {CSRS}-{PPP} service and the coordinates of each measurement epoch were calculated. According to comparison of the coordinates obtained from {CenterPoint} {RTX} to the known coordinates, it was concluded that the 3D real-time positioning achieved at centimeter-level of accuracy within convergence time of a few minutes. On the other hand, {CSRS}-{PPP} also provided centimeter-level accurate positioning with post-processing mode. The overall results show that, the attainable accuracy with both approaches provided the requirements of the many scientific and practical surveying applications.},

	abstract = {The achievable accuracy of bathymetric mapping in the deep ocean using robotic systems is most often limited by the available guidance or navigation information used to combine the measured sonar ranges during the map making process. This paper presents an algorithm designed to mitigate the affects of poor ground referenced navigation by applying the principles of map registration and pose filtering commonly used in simultaneous localization and mapping ({SLAM}) algorithms. The goal of the algorithm is to produce a self-consistent point cloud representation of the bottom terrain with errors that are on a scale similar to the sonar range resolution rather than any direct positioning measurement. The presented algorithm operates causally and utilizes sensor data that are common to instrumented underwater robotic vehicles used for mapping and scientific explorations. Real world results are shown for data taken on several expeditions with the {JASON} remotely operated vehicle ({ROV}). Comparisons are made between more standard mapping approaches and the proposed method is shown to significantly improve the map quality and reveal scene information that would have otherwise been obscured due to poor direct navigation information. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The proposed error measure is based on a disparity measurement between common sections of the environment that have been imaged multiple times. This disparity measure highlights inconsistency in the terrain map by showing regions where multiple overlapping point clouds do not fit together well. This error measure provides the map interpreter with a localized error measurement to help judge the validity of the final point cloud or gridded surface. It is shown that the proposed method highlights mapping errors more clearly than a principle component based measure used in the 3D modelling community.

The time-differenced {GPS} carrier phases, which have low noise and millimeter measurement precision, are integrated with {INS} measurements using a Kalman Filter with high update rates to improve the performance of the integrated system. Since the time-differenced {GPS} carrier phases are only relative measurements, when integrated with {INS}, the position error of the integrated system will accumulate over time. Therefore, the {GPS} pseudoranges are also incorporated into the integrated system using a Kalman Filter with a low update rate to control the accumulation of system errors. Experimental tests have shown that this design, compared to a conventional design using a single Kalman Filter, reduces the coasting error by two-thirds for a medium coasting time of 30 s, and the position, velocity, and attitude errors by at least one-half for a 45-min ﬁeld navigation experiment.},

	abstract = {This book deals with the problems related to planning motion laws and trajectories for the actuation system of automatic machines, in particular for those based on electric drives, and robots. The problem of planning suitable trajectories is relevant not only for the proper use of these machines, in order to avoid undesired effects such as vibrations or even damages on the mechanical structure, but also in some phases of their design and in the choice and sizing of the actuators. This is particularly true now that the concept of “electronic cams” has replaced, in the design of automatic machines, the classical approach based on “mechanical cams”. The choice of a particular trajectory has direct and relevant implications on several aspects of the design and use of an automatic machine, like the dimensioning of the actuators and of the reduction gears, the vibrations and efforts generated on the machine and on the load, the tracking errors during the motion execution. For these reasons, in order to understand and appreciate the peculiarities of the different techniques available for trajectory planning, besides the mathematical aspects of their implementation also a detailed analysis in the time and frequency domains, a comparison of their main properties under different points of view, and general considerations related to their practical use are reported.},

	abstract = {This paper presents experimental results using a newly developed 3D underwater laser scanner mounted on an autonomous underwater vehicle ({AUV}) for real-time simultaneous localization and mapping ({SLAM}). The algorithm consists of registering point clouds using a dual step procedure. First, a feature-based coarse alignment is performed, which is then refined using iterative closest point. The robot position is estimated using an extended Kalman filter ({EKF}) that fuses the data coming from navigation sensors of the {AUV}. Moreover, the pose from where each point cloud was collected is also stored in the pose-based {EKF}-{SLAM} state vector. The results of the registration algorithm are used as constraint observations among the different poses within the state vector, solving the full-{SLAM} problem. The method is demonstrated using the Girona 500 {AUV}, equipped with a laser scanner and inspecting a 3D sub-sea infrastructure inside a water tank. Our results prove that it is possible to limit the navigation drift and deliver a consistent high-accuracy 3D map of the inspected object.},

	doi = {10.1109/ROBOT.1999.772544},
	abstract = {To navigate reliably in indoor environments, a mobile robot must know where it is. Thus, reliable position estimation is a key problem in mobile robotics. We believe that probabilistic approaches are among the most promising candidates to providing a comprehensive and real-time solution to the robot localization problem. However, current methods still face considerable hurdles. In particular the problems encountered are closely related to the type of representation used to represent probability densities over the robot's state space. Earlier work on Bayesian filtering with particle-based density representations opened up a new approach for mobile robot localization based on these principles. We introduce the Monte Carlo localization method, where we represent the probability density involved by maintaining a set of samples that are randomly drawn from it. By using a sampling-based representation we obtain a localization method that can represent arbitrary distributions. We show experimentally that the resulting method is able to efficiently localize a mobile robot without knowledge of its starting location. It is faster, more accurate and less memory-intensive than earlier grid-based methods,.},

	abstract = {Sparse Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting computes the factorization {PAQ} = {LU} of a sparse matrix A , where the row ordering P is selected during factorization using standard partial pivoting with row interchanges. The goal is to select a column preordering, Q , based solely on the nonzero pattern of A , that limits the worst-case number of nonzeros in the factorization. The fill-in also depends on P , but Q is selected to reduce an upper bound on the fill-in for any subsequent choice of P . The choice of Q can have a dramatic impact on the number of nonzeros in L and U . One scheme for determining a good column ordering for A is to compute a symmetric ordering that reduces fill-in in the Cholesky factorization of A T A . A conventional minimum degree ordering algorithm would require the sparsity structure of A T A to be computed, which can be expensive both in terms of space and time since A T A may be much denser than A . An alternative is to compute Q directly from the sparsity structure of A ; this strategy is used by {MATLAB}'s {COLMMD} preordering algorithm. A new ordering algorithm, {COLAMD}, is presented. It is based on the same strategy but uses a better ordering heuristic. {COLAMD} is faster and computes better orderings, with fewer nonzeros in the factors of the matrix.},

The experiments suggest that {PLICP} is more precise, and requires less iterations. However, it is less robust to very large initial displacement errors.

	abstract = {Robotic practitioners generally approach the vision-based {SLAM} problem through discrete-time formulations. This has the advantage of a consolidated theory and very good understanding of success and failure cases. However, discrete time {SLAM} needs tailored algorithms and simplifying assumptions when high-rate and/or asynchronous measurements coming from different sensors are present in the estimation process. Conversely, continuous-time {SLAM}, often overlooked by practitioners, does not suffer from this limitations. Indeed, it allows integrating new sensor data asynchronously without adding new optimization variables for each new measurement. In this way, the integration of asynchronous or continuous high-rate streams of sensor data does not require tailored and highly-engineered algorithms, enabling the fusion of multiple sensor modalities in an intuitive fashion. On the down side, continuous time introduces a prior that could worsen the trajectory estimates in some unfavorable situations. In this work, we aim at systematically comparing the advantages and limitations of the two formulations in vision-based {SLAM}. To do so, we perform an extensive experimental analysis, varying robot type, speed of motion, and sensor modalities. Our experimental analysis suggests that, independently of the trajectory type, continuous-time {SLAM} is superior to its discrete counterpart whenever the sensors are not time synchronized. In the context of this work, we developed a modular, efficient software architecture containing state-of-the-art algorithms to solve the {SLAM} problem in discrete and continuous time. We will release the code fully open-source upon acceptance.},

	abstract = {The recent success of object detection systems motivates object-based representations for robot navigation; i.e. semantic simultaneous localization and mapping ({SLAM}). The semantic {SLAM} problem can be decomposed into a discrete inference problem: determining object class labels and measurement-landmark correspondences (the data association problem), and a continuous inference problem: obtaining the set of robot poses and object locations in the environment. A solution to the semantic {SLAM} problem necessarily addresses this joint inference, but under ambiguous data associations this is in general a non-Gaussian inference problem, while the majority of previous work focuses on Gaussian inference. Previous solutions to data association either produce solutions between potential hypotheses or maintain multiple explicit hypotheses for each association. We propose a solution that represents hypotheses as multiple modes of an equivalent non-Gaussian sensor model. We then solve the resulting non-Gaussian inference problem using nonparametric belief propagation. We validate our approach in a simulated hallway environment under a variety of sensor noise characteristics, as well as using real data from the {KITTI} dataset, demonstrating improved robustness to perceptual aliasing and odometry uncertainty.},

An ever growing pose graph, however, prevents long-term mapping with mobile robots. In this paper, we address the problem of efficient information-theoretic compression of pose graphs. Our approach estimates the mutual information between the laser measurements and the map to discard the measurements that are expected to provide only a small amount of information. Our method subsequently marginalizes out the nodes from the pose graph that correspond to the discarded laser measurements. To maintain a sparse pose graph that allows for efficient map optimization, our approach applies an approximate marginalization technique that is based on Chow?Liu trees. Our contributions allow the robot to effectively restrict the size of the pose graph. Alternatively, the robot is able to maintain a pose graph that does not grow unless the robot explores previously unobserved parts of the environment. Real-world experiments demonstrate that our approach to pose graph compression is well suited for long-term mobile robot mapping.},

The size of the pose graph has a direct influence on the runtime and the memory requirements of a {SLAM} system since it is typically used to make data associations and within the optimization procedure. In this paper, we address the problem of efficient, information-theoretic compression of such pose graphs. The central question is which sensor measurements can be removed from the graph without loosing too much information. Our approach estimates the expected information gain of laser measurements with respect to the resulting occupancy grid map. It allows us to restrict the size of the pose graph depending on the information that the robot acquires about the environment. Alternatively, we can enforce a maximum number of laser scans the robot is allowed to store, which results in an any-space {SLAM} system. Real world experiments suggest that our approach efficiently reduces the growth of the pose graph while minimizing the loss of information in the resulting grid map.},

	abstract = {Egomotion and scene estimation is a key component in automating robot navigation, as well as in virtual reality applications for mobile phones or head-mounted displays. It is well known, however, that with long exploratory trajectories and multi-session mapping for long-term autonomy or collaborative applications, the maintenance of the ever-increasing size of these maps quickly becomes a bottleneck. With the explosion of data resulting in increasing runtime of the optimization algorithms ensuring the accuracy of the Simultaneous Localization And Mapping ({SLAM}) estimates, the large quantity of collected experiences is imposing hard limits on the scalability of such techniques. Considering the keyframe-based paradigm of {SLAM} techniques, this paper investigates the redundancy inherent in {SLAM} maps, by quantifying the information of different experiences of the scene as encoded in keyframes. Here we propose and evaluate different information-theoretic and heuristic metrics to remove dispensable scene measurements with minimal impact on the accuracy of the {SLAM} estimates. Evaluating the proposed metrics in two state-of-the-art centralized collaborative {SLAM} systems, we provide our key insights into how to identify redundancy in keyframe-based {SLAM}.},

	abstract = {We describe a general approach to smoothing and mapping with a class of discrete-continuous factor graphs commonly encountered in robotics applications. While there are openly available tools providing flexible and easy-to-use interfaces for specifying and solving optimization problems formulated in terms of either discrete or continuous graphical models, at present, no similarly general tools exist enabling the same functionality for hybrid discrete-continuous problems. We aim to address this problem. In particular, we provide a library, {DC}-{SAM}, extending existing tools for optimization problems defined in terms of factor graphs to the setting of discrete-continuous models. A key contribution of our work is a novel solver for efficiently recovering approximate solutions to discrete-continuous optimization problems. The key insight to our approach is that while joint inference over continuous and discrete state spaces is often hard, many commonly encountered discrete-continuous problems can naturally be split into a "discrete part" and a "continuous part" that can individually be solved easily. Leveraging this structure, we optimize discrete and continuous variables in an alternating fashion. In consequence, our proposed work enables straightforward representation of and approximate inference in discrete-continuous graphical models. We also provide a method to recover the uncertainty in estimates of both discrete and continuous variables. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach through its application to three distinct robot perception applications: point-cloud registration, robust pose graph optimization, and object-based mapping and localization.},

	abstract = {The two-dimensional (2D) lidar is a ranging optical sensor that can measure the cross-section of the geometric structure of the environment. We propose a robust 2D lidar simultaneous localization and mapping ({SLAM}) algorithm working in ambiguous environments. To improve the front-end scan-matching module’s accuracy and robustness, we propose performing degeneration analysis, line landmark tracking, and environment coverage analysis. The max-clique selection and odometer verification are introduced to increase the stability of the {SLAM} algorithm in an ambiguous environment. Moreover, we propose a tightly coupled framework that integrates lidar, wheel odometer, and inertial measurement unit ({IMU}). The framework achieves the accurate mapping in large-scale environments using a factor graph to model the multi-sensor fusion {SLAM} problem. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a highly accurate front-end scan-matching module with an error of 3.8\% of the existing method. And it can run stably in ambiguous environments where the existing method will be failed. Moreover, it ccan successfully construct a map with an area of more than 250 000 square meters.},

Even in a myriad of applications and environments, there exists a common vocabulary of components that robots share—the need for a modular, scalable, and reliable architecture; sensing; planning; mobility; and autonomy. The Robot Operating System ({ROS}) was an integral part of the last chapter, demonstrably expediting robotics research with freely available components and a modular framework. However, {ROS} 1 was not designed with many necessary production-grade features and algorithms. {ROS} 2 and its related projects have been redesigned from the ground up to meet the challenges set forth by modern robotic systems in new and exploratory domains at all scales. In this Review, we highlight the philosophical and architectural changes of {ROS} 2 powering this new chapter in the robotics revolution. We also show through case studies the influence {ROS} 2 and its adoption has had on accelerating real robot systems to reliable deployment in an assortment of challenging environments.

This so-called simultaneous localization and mapping ({SLAM}) problem has been one of the most popular research topics in mobile robotics for the last two decades and efficient approaches for solving this task have been proposed. One intuitive way of formulating {SLAM} is to use a graph whose nodes correspond to the poses of the robot at different points in time and whose edges represent constraints between the poses. The latter are obtained from observations of the environment or from movement actions carried out by the robot. Once such a graph is constructed, the map can be computed by finding the spatial configuration of the nodes that is mostly consistent with the measurements modeled by the edges. In this paper, we provide an introductory description to the graph-based {SLAM} problem. Furthermore, we discuss a state-of-the-art solution that is based on least-squares error minimization and exploits the structure of the {SLAM} problems during optimization. The goal of this tutorial is to enable the reader to implement the proposed methods from scratch.},

Since the first foundational work in active perception appeared, more than three decades ago, this field has received increasing attention across different scientific communities. This has brought about many different approaches and formulations, and makes a review of the current trends necessary and extremely valuable for both new and experienced researchers. In this work, we survey the state-of-the-art in active {SLAM} and take an in-depth look at the open challenges that still require attention to meet the needs of modern applications. \% in order to achieve real-world deployment. After providing a historical perspective, we present a unified problem formulation and review the classical solution scheme, which decouples the problem into three stages that identify, select, and execute potential navigation actions. We then analyze alternative approaches, including belief-space planning and modern techniques based on deep reinforcement learning, and review related work on multi-robot coordination. The manuscript concludes with a discussion of new research directions, addressing reproducible research, active spatial perception, and practical applications, among other topics.},

This new method provides analytical expressions for the solutions of the problem, instead of the traditional numerical procedures. As a result, expressions of the translation vector, rotation matrix and object-plane normal are explicitly expressed as a function of the entries of the homography matrix. The main advantage of this method is that it will provide a deeper understanding on the homography decomposition problem. For instance, it allows to obtain the relations among the possible solutions of the problem. Thus, new vision-based robot control laws can be designed. For example the control schemes proposed in this report combine the two ﬁnal solutions of the problem (only one of them being the true one) assuming that there is no a priori knowledge for discerning among them.},

Nevertheless, the price of mechanical {LiDAR} is exceptionally high compared with other sensors, which is the primary reason to introduce a new generation of laser called Solid-State {LiDAR} ({SSL}). In this paper, we introduce a back-ground of {SSL} and several types of commercial {SSL} and also their characteristic. For developing {SLAM} framework, we discuss several successful {SLAM} architectures, which can be capable of integrating into a navigation system for the mobile robot. Last, we propose a low-cost {SLAM} framework using the visual-inertial-{SSL}, that can not only reduce the price of a mobile industrial robot but also provide excellent performance.},

After summarizing the basic idea of {SLAM} and the necessity of multi-sensor fusion, this paper introduces the basic principles and recent work of multi-sensor fusion in detail from four aspects based on the types of fused sensors and data coupling methods. Meanwhile, we review some {SLAM} datasets and compare the performance of ﬁve open-source algorithms using the {UrbanNav} dataset. Finally, the development trend and popular research directions of {SLAM} based on 3D {LIDAR} multi-sensor fusion are discussed and summarized.},

	abstract = {Research in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping ({SLAM}) has made outstanding progress over the past years. {SLAM} systems are nowadays transitioning from academic to real world applications. However, this transition has posed new demanding challenges in terms of accuracy and robustness. To develop new {SLAM} systems that can address these challenges, new datasets containing cutting-edge hardware and realistic scenarios are required. We propose the Hilti {SLAM} Challenge Dataset. Our dataset contains indoor sequences of offices, labs, and construction environments and outdoor sequences of construction sites and parking areas. All these sequences are characterized by featureless areas and varying illumination conditions that are typical in real-world scenarios and pose great challenges to {SLAM} algorithms that have been developed in confined lab environments. Accurate sparse ground truth, at millimeter level, is provided for each sequence. The sensor platform used to record the data includes a number of visual, lidar, and inertial sensors, which are spatially and temporally calibrated. The purpose of this dataset is to foster the research in sensor fusion to develop {SLAM} algorithms that can be deployed in tasks where high accuracy and robustness are required, e.g., in construction environments. Many academic and industrial groups tested their {SLAM} systems on the proposed dataset in the Hilti {SLAM} Challenge. The results of the challenge, which are summarized in this paper, show that the proposed dataset is an important asset in the development of new {SLAM} algorithms that are ready to be deployed in the real-world.},

By using a fast approximation of map gradients and a multi-resolution grid, reliable localization and mapping capabilities in a variety of challenging environments are realized. Multiple datasets showing the applicability in an embedded handheld mapping system are provided. We show that the system is sufﬁciently accurate as to not require explicit loop closing techniques in the considered scenarios. The software is available as an open source package for {ROS}.},

	title = {The Banana Distribution is Gaussian: A Localization Study with Exponential Coordinates},
	abstract = {Distributions in position and orientation are central to many problems in robot localization. To increase efﬁciency, a majority of algorithms for planar mobile robots use Gaussians deﬁned on positional Cartesian coordinates and heading. However, the distribution of poses for a noisy two-wheeled robot moving in the plane has been observed by many to be a “bananashaped” distribution, which is clearly not Gaussian/normal in these coordinates. As uncertainty increases, many localization algorithms therefore become “inconsistent” due to the normality assumption breaking down. We observe that this is because the combination of Cartesian coordinates and heading is not the most appropriate set of coordinates to use, and that the banana distribution can be described in closed form as a Gaussian in an alternative set of coordinates via the so-called exponential map. With this formulation, we can derive closed-form expressions for propagating the mean and covariance of the Gaussian in these exponential coordinates for a differential-drive car moving along a trajectory constructed from sections of straight segments and arcs of constant curvature. In addition, we detail how to fuse two or more Gaussians in exponential coordinates together with given relative pose measurements between robots moving in formation. These propagation and fusion formulas utilized here reduce uncertainty in localization better than when using traditional methods. We demonstrate with numerical examples dramatic improvements in the estimated pose of three robots moving in formation when compared to classical Cartesiancoordinate-based Gaussian fusion methods.},

	abstract = {Although 2D {LiDAR} based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping ({SLAM}) is a relatively mature topic nowadays, the loop closure problem remains challenging due to the lack of distinctive features in 2D {LiDAR} range scans. Existing research can be roughly divided into correlation based approaches e.g. scan-to-submap matching and feature based methods e.g. bag-of-words ({BoW}). In this paper, we solve loop closure detection and relative pose transformation using 2D {LiDAR} within an end-to-end Deep Learning framework. The algorithm is verified with simulation data and on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle ({UAV}) flying in indoor environment. The loop detection {ConvNet} alone achieves an accuracy of 98.2\% in loop closure detection. With a verification step using the scan matching {ConvNet}, the false positive rate drops to around 0.001\%. The proposed approach processes 6000 pairs of raw {LiDAR} scans per second on a Nvidia {GTX}1080 {GPU}.},

	doi = {10.1109/TPAMI.2017.2773482},
	abstract = {An established approach for 3D point cloud registration is to estimate the registration function from 3D keypoint correspondences. Typically, a robust technique is required to conduct the estimation, since there are false correspondences or outliers. Current 3D keypoint techniques are much less accurate than their 2D counterparts, thus they tend to produce extremely high outlier rates. A large number of putative correspondences must thus be extracted to ensure that sufficient good correspondences are available. Both factors (high outlier rates, large data sizes) however cause existing robust techniques to require very high computational cost. In this paper, we present a novel preprocessing method called guaranteed outlier removal for point cloud registration. Our method reduces the input to a smaller set, in a way that any rejected correspondence is guaranteed to not exist in the globally optimal solution. The reduction is performed using purely geometric operations which are deterministic and fast. Our method significantly reduces the population of outliers, such that further optimization can be performed quickly. Further, since only true outliers are removed, the globally optimal solution is preserved. On various synthetic and real data experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our preprocessing method. Demo code is available as supplementary material, which can be found on the Computer Society Digital Library at http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org.proxy3.library.mcgill.ca/10.1109/{TPAMI}.2017.2773482.},

This work proposes the use of point clouds for obstacle-aware indoor pathfinding. Point clouds are firstly used for reconstructing semantically rich 3D models of building structural elements in order to extract initial navigational information. Potential obstacles to navigation are classified in the point cloud and directly used to correct the path according to the mobility skills of different users. The methodology is tested in several real case studies for wheelchair and ordinary users. Experiments show that, after several iterations, paths are readapted to avoid obstacles.},

The library goes beyond existing visual and visual-inertial {SLAM} libraries (e.g., {ORB}-{SLAM}, {VINS}- Mono, {OKVIS}, {ROVIO}) by enabling mesh reconstruction and semantic labeling in 3D. Kimera is designed with modularity in mind and has four key components: a visual-inertial odometry ({VIO}) module for fast and accurate state estimation, a robust pose graph optimizer for global trajectory estimation, a lightweight 3D mesher module for fast mesh reconstruction, and a dense 3D metric-semantic reconstruction module. The modules can be run in isolation or in combination, hence Kimera can easily fall back to a state-of-the-art {VIO} or a full {SLAM} system. Kimera runs in real-time on a {CPU} and produces a 3D metric-semantic mesh from semantically labeled images, which can be obtained by modern deep learning methods. We hope that the flexibility, computational efficiency, robustness, and accuracy afforded by Kimera will build a solid basis for future metric-semantic {SLAM} and perception research, and will allow researchers across multiple areas (e.g., {VIO}, {SLAM}, 3D reconstruction, segmentation) to benchmark and prototype their own efforts without having to start from scratch.},

	abstract = {Simultaneous localization and mapping ({SLAM}) is a core element of every autonomous mobile robot. The underlying engine of a {SLAM} system is its back-end, which aims at optimally estimating the trajectory and map of the environment based on sensor data abstractions. Over the past decade, {SLAM} solutions based on graph optimization approaches prevailed over the filtering based solutions, since they dominated in performance over a wider range of applications. In this paper we propose a novel filtering based {SLAM} back-end based on the exactly sparse delayed state filter ({ESDSF}) derived on Lie groups ({LG}-{ESDSF}). The proposed filter retains all the good characteristics of the classic {ESDSF}, but also respects the state space geometry by employing filtering equations directly on Lie groups. We have compared our {SLAM} system with two current state-of-the-art {SLAM} solutions, namely {ORB}-{SLAM} and {LSD}-{SLAM}, on the {KITTI} vision benchmark suite. Test results show that the proposed {SLAM} based on the {LG}-{ESDSF} back-end can achieve same level of accuracy as the methods based on the graph optimization techniques, while maintaining lower computation times.},

	abstract = {We present a novel method for generating, predicting, and using Spatiotemporal Occupancy Grid Maps ({SOGM}), which embed future information of dynamic scenes. Our automated generation process creates groundtruth {SOGMs} from previous navigation data. We build on prior work to annotate lidar points based on their dynamic properties, which are then projected on time-stamped 2D grids: {SOGMs}. We design a 3D-2D feedforward architecture, trained to predict the future time steps of {SOGMs}, given 3D lidar frames as input. Our pipeline is entirely self-supervised, thus enabling lifelong learning for robots. The network is composed of a 3D back-end that extracts rich features and enables the semantic segmentation of the lidar frames, and a 2D front-end that predicts the future information embedded in the {SOGMs} within planning. We also design a navigation pipeline that uses these predicted {SOGMs}. We provide both quantitative and qualitative insights into the predictions and validate our choices of network design with a comparison to the state of the art and ablation studies.},

These algorithms are evaluated in environments of different structure, focusing on problems commonly encountered when a mobile device camera is used. The conclusions drawn from this evaluation are guidelines to design the {FastABLE} system, which is based on the {ABLE}-M algorithm but introduces major modiﬁcations to the concept of image matching. The improvements radically cut down the processing time and improve scalability, making it possible to localize the user in long image sequences with the limited computing power of a mobile device. The resulting place recognition system compares favorably to both the {ABLE}-M and the {FAB}-{MAP} solutions in the context of real-time personal localization.},

The methodology trains Gaussian processes on the residual between the original model and the ground truth, and is applied on publicly available datasets for robot navigation based on two wheel encoders, a fiber optic gyro, and an Inertial Measurement Unit ({IMU}). We also propose to build an Extended Kalman Filter ({EKF}) on the learned model using wheel speed sensors and the fiber optic gyro for state propagation, and the {IMU} to update the estimated state. Experimental results clearly demonstrate that the (learned) corrected models and {EKF} are more accurate than their original counterparts.},

	abstract = {Odometry forms an important component of many manned and autonomous systems. In the rail industry in particular, having precise and robust odometry is crucial for the correct operation of the Automatic Train Protection systems that ensure the safety of high-speed trains in operation around the world. Two problems commonly encountered in such odometry systems are miscalibration of the wheel encoders and slippage of the wheels under acceleration and braking, resulting in incorrect velocity estimates. This paper introduces an odometry system that addresses these problems. It comprises of an Extended Kalman Filter that tracks the calibration of the wheel encoders as state variables, and a measurement pre-processing stage called Sensor Consensus Analysis ({SCA}) that scales the uncertainty of a measurement based on how consistent it is with the measurements from the other sensors. {SCA} uses the statistical z-test to determine when an individual measurement is inconsistent with the other measurements, and scales the uncertainty until the z-test passes. This system is demonstrated on data from German Intercity-Express high-speed trains and it is shown to successfully deal with errors due to miscalibration and wheel slip.},

While neural radiance fields have seen significant applications for visual rendering in computer vision and graphics, they have found limited use in robotics. Existing approaches for {NeRF}-based localization require both a good initial pose guess and significant computation, making them impractical for real-time robotics applications. By using Monte Carlo localization as a workhorse to estimate poses using a {NeRF} map model, Loc-{NeRF} is able to perform localization faster than the state of the art and without relying on an initial pose estimate. In addition to testing on synthetic data, we also run our system using real data collected by a Clearpath Jackal {UGV} and demonstrate for the first time the ability to perform real-time global localization with neural radiance fields.

	abstract = {One of the key tasks during the realization of probabilistic approaches to localization is the design of a proper sensor model, that calculates the likelihood of a measurement given the current pose of the vehicle and the map of the environment. In the past, range sensors have become popular for mobile robot localization since they directly measure distance. However, in situations in which the robot operates close to edges of obstacles or in highly cluttered environments, small changes in the pose of the robot can lead to large variations in the acquired range scans. If the sensor model used does not appropriately characterize the resulting ﬂuctuations, the performance of probabilistic approaches may substantially degrade. A common solution is to artiﬁcially smooth the likelihood function or to only integrate a small fraction of the measurements. In this paper we present a more fundamental and robust approach which uses mixtures of Gaussians to model the likelihood function for single range measurements. In practical experiments we compare our approach to previous methods and demonstrate that it yields a substantially increase in robustness.},

By removing a majority of parts and focusing on the core elements, we obtain a surprisingly effective system that is simple to realize and can operate under various environmental conditions using different {LiDAR} sensors. Our odometry estimation approach relies on point-to-point {ICP} combined with adaptive thresholding for correspondence matching, a robust kernel, a simple but widely applicable motion compensation approach, and a point cloud subsampling strategy. This yields a system with only a few parameters that in most cases do not even have to be tuned to a specific {LiDAR} sensor. Our system using the same parameters performs on par with state-of-the-art methods under various operating conditions using different platforms: automotive platforms, {UAV}-based operation, vehicles like segways, or handheld {LiDARs}. We do not require integrating {IMU} information and solely rely on 3D point cloud data obtained from a wide range of 3D {LiDAR} sensors, thus, enabling a broad spectrum of different applications and operating conditions. Our open-source system operates faster than the sensor frame rate in all presented datasets and is designed for real-world scenarios.},

However, this formulation does not naturally support long-term autonomy because it lacks a notion of environmental change; in reality, “everything changes and nothing stands still,” and any mapping and localization system that aims to support truly persistent autonomy must be similarly adaptive. To that end, in this paper we propose a novel feature-based model of environmental evolution over time. Our approach is based upon the development of an expressive probabilistic generative feature persistence model that describes the survival of abstract semi-static environmental features over time. We show that this model admits a recursive Bayesian estimator, the persistence ﬁlter, that provides an exact online method for computing, at each moment in time, an explicit Bayesian belief over the persistence of each feature in the environment. By incorporating this feature persistence estimation into current state-of-the-art graphical mapping techniques, we obtain a ﬂexible, computationally efﬁcient, and information-theoretically rigorous framework for lifelong environmental modeling in an ever-changing world.},

In this paper we present a probabilistic grid-based approach for modeling changing environments. Our method represents both, the occupancy and its changes in the corresponding area where the dynamics are characterized by the state transition probabilities of a Hidden Markov Model. We apply an ofﬂine and an online technique to learn the parameters from observed data. The advantage of the online approach is that it can dynamically adapt the parameters and at the same time does not require storing the complete observation sequences. Experimental results obtained with data acquired by real robots demonstrate that our model is well-suited for representing changing environments.

During navigation, our robot builds temporally local maps and integrates then into the global spatio-temporal grid. Through re-observation of the same locations, the spatio-temporal grid learns the longterm environment dynamics and gains the ability to predict the future environment states. This predictive ability allows to generate time-speciﬁc 2d maps used by the robot’s localisation and planning modules. By analysing data from a long-term deployment of the robot in a human-populated environment, we show that the proposed representation improves localisation accuracy and the efﬁciency of path planning.

	abstract = {Maintaining a map of an environment that changes over time is a critical challenge in the development of persistently autonomous mobile robots. Many previous approaches to mapping assume a static world. In this work we incorporate the time dimension into the mapping process to enable a robot to maintain an accurate map while operating in dynamical environments. This paper presents Dynamic Pose Graph {SLAM} ({DPG}-{SLAM}), an algorithm designed to enable a robot to remain localized in an environment that changes substantially over time. Using incremental smoothing and mapping ({iSAM}) as the underlying {SLAM} state estimation engine, the Dynamic Pose Graph evolves over time as the robot explores new places and revisits previously mapped areas. The approach has been implemented for planar indoor environments, using laser scan matching to derive constraints for {SLAM} state estimation. Laser scans for the same portion of the environment at different times are compared to perform change detection; when sufﬁcient change has occurred in a location, the dynamic pose graph is edited to remove old poses and scans that no longer match the current state of the world. Experimental results are shown for two real-world dynamic indoor laser data sets, demonstrating the ability to maintain an up-to-date map despite long-term environmental changes.},

	abstract = {Common estimation algorithms, such as least squares estimation or the Kalman filter, operate on a state in a state space S that is represented as a real-valued vector. However, for many quantities, most notably orientations in 3D, S is not a vector space, but a so-called manifold, i.e. it behaves like a vector space locally but has a more complex global topological structure. For integrating these quantities, several ad-hoc approaches have been proposed. Here, we present a principled solution to this problem where the structure of the manifold S is encapsulated by two operators, state displacement [+]:S x R{\textasciicircum}n --{\textgreater} S and its inverse [-]: S x S --{\textgreater} R{\textasciicircum}n. These operators provide a local vector-space view {\textbackslash}delta; --{\textgreater} x [+] {\textbackslash}delta; around a given state x. Generic estimation algorithms can then work on the manifold S mainly by replacing +/- with [+]/[-] where appropriate. We analyze these operators axiomatically, and demonstrate their use in least-squares estimation and the Unscented Kalman Filter. Moreover, we exploit the idea of encapsulation from a software engineering perspective in the Manifold Toolkit, where the [+]/[-] operators mediate between a "flat-vector" view for the generic algorithm and a "named-members" view for the problem specific functions.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel method for continuous integration over the 3D rotation group {SO}(3). The key idea is to model the system’s dynamics with Gaussian Processes ({GPs}) and learn the {GP} training data to match the system’s instantaneous angular velocity measurements. This is formulated as the minimisation of a simple cost function that leverages the application of linear operators over {GP} kernels. The proposed integration method over {SO}(3) is applied to the preintegration of inertial data provided by a 6-{DoF}-Inertial Measurement Unit ({IMU}). Unlike standard integration that requires the recomputation of the integrals every time the estimate changes, preintegration combines the {IMU} readings into pseudo-measurements that are independent from the pose estimate and allows for efﬁcient multimodal sensor-fusion. The pseudo-measurements generated by the proposed method are named Uniﬁed Gaussian Preintegrated Measurements ({UGPMs}). {UGPMs} rely on {GP} regression and linear operators to analytically integrate the acceleration data. Moreover, a mechanism for {IMU} bias and time-shift correction is introduced to allow for seamless multi-modal state estimation. Over quantitative experiments, we show that the {UGPMs} outperform the current state-of-the-art preintegration methods.},

	abstract = {Many important geometric estimation problems naturally take the form of synchronization over the special Euclidean group: estimate the values of a set of unknown group elements x1, . . . , xn ∈ {SE}( d) given noisy measurements of a subset of their pairwise relative transforms x−i 1xj. Examples of this class include the foundational problems of pose-graph simultaneous localization and mapping ({SLAM}) (in robotics), camera motion estimation (in computer vision), and sensor network localization (in distributed sensing), among others. This inference problem is typically formulated as a non-convex maximum-likelihood estimation that is computationally hard to solve in general. Nevertheless, in this paper we present an algorithm that is able to efﬁciently recover certiﬁably globally optimal solutions of the special Euclidean synchronization problem in a non-adversarial noise regime. The crux of our approach is the development of a semideﬁnite relaxation of the maximum-likelihood estimation ({MLE}) whose minimizer provides an exact maximum-likelihood estimate so long as the magnitude of the noise corrupting the available measurements falls below a certain critical threshold; furthermore, whenever exactness obtains, it is possible to verify this fact a posteriori, thereby certifying the optimality of the recovered estimate. We develop a specialized optimization scheme for solving large-scale instances of this semideﬁnite relaxation by exploiting its low-rank, geometric, and graph-theoretic structure to reduce it to an equivalent optimization problem deﬁned on a low-dimensional Riemannian manifold, and then design a Riemannian truncated-Newton trust-region method to solve this reduction efﬁciently. Finally, we combine this fast optimization approach with a simple rounding procedure to produce our algorithm, {SE}-Sync. Experimental evaluation on a variety of simulated and real-world pose-graph {SLAM} datasets shows that {SE}-Sync is capable of recovering certiﬁably globally optimal solutions when the available measurements are corrupted by noise up to an order of magnitude greater than that typically encountered in robotics and computer vision applications, and does so signiﬁcantly faster than the Gauss–Newton-based approach that forms the basis of current state-of-the-art techniques.},

The solution provides tools critical for creation, validation, experimentation and deployment of imaging systems with far reaching applications in vision systems and mobile robotics. The proposed calibration protocol uses three pose estimates: thepose of camera w.r.t fiducial markers, the pose of fiducial marker w.r.t {MoCap} defined global frame and the pose of camera marker w.r.t. {MoCap} defined global frame to produce a real-time stream of the calibration parameters. The Robot Operating System ({ROS}) serves to interpolate sensed pose data to create time-synchronous pose estimates from which the extrinsic parameters can be directly calculated.

	abstract = {Many estimation problems in robotics, computer vision, and learning require estimating unknown quantities in the face of outliers. Outliers are typically the result of incorrect data association or feature matching, and it is common to have problems where more than 90\% of the measurements used for estimation are outliers. While current approaches for robust estimation are able to deal with moderate amounts of outliers, they fail to produce accurate estimates in the presence of many outliers. This paper develops an approach to prune outliers. First, we develop a theory of invariance that allows us to quickly check if a subset of measurements are mutually compatible without explicitly solving the estimation problem. Second, we develop a graph-theoretic framework, where measurements are modeled as vertices and mutual compatibility is captured by edges. We generalize existing results showing that the inliers form a clique in this graph and typically belong to the maximum clique. We also show that in practice the maximum k-core of the compatibility graph provides an approximation of the maximum clique, while being faster to compute in large problems. These two contributions leads to {ROBIN}, our approach to Reject Outliers Based on {INvariants}, which allows us to quickly prune outliers in generic estimation problems. We demonstrate {ROBIN} in four geometric perception problems and show it boosts robustness of existing solvers while running in milliseconds in large problems.},

In this paper, we show that Lagrangian duality allows computing a globally optimal solution, under certain conditions that are satisfied in many practical cases. Our first contribution is to frame the {PGO} problem in the complex domain. This makes analysis easier and allows drawing connections with the recent literature on unit gain graphs. Exploiting this connection we prove non-trival results about the spectrum of the matrix underlying the problem. The second contribution is to formulate and analyze the dual problem in the complex domain. Our analysis shows that the duality gap is connected to the number of eigenvalues of the penalized pose graph matrix, which arises from the solution of the dual. We prove that if this matrix has a single eigenvalue in zero, then (i) the duality gap is zero, (ii) the primal {PGO} problem has a unique solution, and (iii) the primal solution can be computed by scaling an eigenvector of the penalized pose graph matrix. The third contribution is algorithmic: we exploit the dual problem and propose an algorithm that computes a guaranteed optimal solution for {PGO} when the penalized pose graph matrix satisfies the Single Zero Eigenvalue Property ({SZEP}). We also propose a variant that deals with the case in which the {SZEP} is not satisfied. The fourth contribution is a numerical analysis. Empirical evidence shows that in the vast majority of cases (100\% of the tests under noise regimes of practical robotics applications) the penalized pose graph matrix does satisfy the {SZEP}, hence our approach allows computing the global optimal solution. Finally, we report simple counterexamples in which the duality gap is nonzero, and discuss open problems.},

In its conventional form, rotation averaging is stated as a minimization over multiple rotation constraints. As these constraints are non-convex, this problem is generally considered challenging to solve globally. We show how to circumvent this difficulty through the use of Lagrangian duality. While such an approach is well-known it is normally not guaranteed to provide a tight relaxation. Based on spectral graph theory, we analytically prove that in many cases there is no duality gap unless the noise levels are severe. This allows us to obtain certifiably global solutions to a class of important non-convex problems in polynomial time. We also propose an efficient, scalable algorithm that out-performs general purpose numerical solvers and is able to handle the large problem instances commonly occurring in structure from motion settings. The potential of this proposed method is demonstrated on a number of different problems, consisting of both synthetic and real-world data.},

Basically, all error minimization procedures that work on real-world data use robust kernels as the standard way for dealing with outliers in the data. These kernels, however, are often hand-picked, sometimes in different combinations, and their parameters need to be tuned manually for a particular problem. In this paper, we propose the use of a generalized robust kernel family, which is automatically tuned based on the distribution of the residuals and includes the common m-estimators. We tested our adaptive kernel with two popular estimation problems in robotics, namely {ICP} and bundle adjustment. The experiments presented in this paper suggest that our approach provides higher robustness while avoiding a manual tuning of the kernel parameters.},

This article reviews recent progress in {SLAM}, focusing on advances in the expressive capacity of the environmental models used in {SLAM} systems (representation) and the performance of the algorithms used to estimate these models from data (inference). A prominent theme of recent {SLAM} research is the pursuit of environmental representations (including learned representations) that go beyond the classical attributes of geometry and appearance to model properties such as hierarchical organization, affordance, dynamics, and semantics; these advances equip autonomous agents with a more comprehensive understanding of the world, enabling more versatile and intelligent operation. A second major theme is a revitalized interest in the mathematical properties of the {SLAM} estimation problem itself (including its computational and information-theoretic performance limits); this work has led to the development of novel classes of certifiable and robust inference methods that dramatically improve the reliability of {SLAM} systems in real-world operation. We survey these advances with an emphasis on their ramifications for achieving robust, long-duration autonomy, and conclude with a discussion of open challenges and a perspective on future research directions.},

In several classes of problems a natural partition arises among variables involved in the estimation. A subset of the variables are actually of interest for the user: we call those target variables. The remaining variables are essential for the formulation of the optimization problem underlying maximum a posteriori ({MAP}) estimation; however these variables, that we call support variables, are not strictly required as output of the estimation problem. In this paper, we propose a systematic way to abstract support variables, deﬁning optimization problems that are only deﬁned over the set of target variables. This abstraction naturally leads to the deﬁnition of smart factors, which correspond to constraints among target variables. We show that this perspective uniﬁes the treatment of heterogeneous problems, ranging from structureless bundle adjustment to robust estimation in {SLAM}. Moreover, it enables to exploit the underlying structure of the optimization problem and the treatment of degenerate instances, enhancing both computational efﬁciency and robustness.},

In this paper, we consider the task of long-term localization in a changing indoor environment given sparse {CAD} ﬂoor plans. The commonly used pre-built maps from the robot sensors may increase the cost and time of deployment. Furthermore, their detailed nature requires that they are updated when signiﬁcant changes occur. We address the difﬁculty of localization when the correspondence between the map and the observations is low due to the sparsity of the {CAD} map and the changing environment. To overcome both challenges, we propose to exploit semantic cues that are commonly present in human-oriented spaces. These semantic cues can be detected using {RGB} cameras by utilizing object detection, and are matched against an easy-to-update, abstract semantic map. The semantic information is integrated into a Monte Carlo localization framework using a particle ﬁlter that operates on 2D {LiDAR} scans and camera data. We provide a long-term localization solution and a semantic map format, for environments that undergo changes to their interior structure and detailed geometric maps are not available. We evaluate our localization framework on multiple challenging indoor scenarios in an ofﬁce environment, taken weeks apart. The experiments suggest that our approach is robust to structural changes and can run on an onboard computer. We released the open source implementation1 of our approach written in C++ together with a {ROS} wrapper.},

In this paper, we propose a memory and computationally efficient monocular camera-based localization system that allows a robot to estimate its pose given an architectural floor plan. Our method employs a convolutional neural network to predict room layout edges from a single camera image and estimates the robot pose using a particle filter that matches the extracted edges to the given floor plan.

Observing the ceiling using an upward-looking camera that has a stable ﬁeld of view can help the robot avoid the disturbance created by dynamic obstacles. Aiming at the indoor environment, we propose a new ceiling-view visual odometry method that introduces plane constraints as additional conditions. By exploiting the coplanar structural constraints of the features, our method achieves better accuracy and stability in a ceiling scene with repeated texture. Given a series of ceiling images, we ﬁrst use the semi-direct method with the coplanar constraint to preliminarily calculate the relative pose between camera frames and then exploit the ceiling plane as an additional constraint. In this step, the photometric error and the geometric constraint are both optimized in a sliding window to further improve the trajectory accuracy. Due to the lack of datasets for ceiling scenes, we also present a dataset for the ceiling-view visual odometry for which the {LiDAR}-Inertial {SLAM} method provides the ground truth. Finally, through an actual scene test, we verify that, in the ceiling environment, our method performs better than the existing visual odometry approach.},

A single upward-facing digital camera was mounted on an autonomous vehicle and used as a vision sensor to identify artiﬁcial landmarks and any natural corner features. An interest point detector was used to ﬁnd the natural features. Using an optical ﬂow detection algorithm, information related to the direction and vehicle translation was deﬁned. This information was used to track the vehicle movements. Random noise related to uneven light disrupted the calculation of the vehicle translation. Thus, to estimate the vehicle translation, a Kalman ﬁlter was used to calculate the vehicle position. These algorithms were tested on a vehicle in a real environment. The image processing method could recognize the landmarks precisely, while the Kalman ﬁlter algorithm could estimate the vehicle’s position accurately. The experimental results conﬁrmed that the proposed approaches can be implemented in practical situations.},

Man-made constructions often have a documented blueprint which can be used as input information for robot localization and smart home applications. However, home environments commonly include movable objects and furniture, which can make localization a complicated task, especially for forwardfacing horizontal rangeﬁnders. In this paper, we present a new and effective global localization approach for home environments which adapts the notion of free space density to a camera pointing to the ceiling. We exploit the available blueprint information, as well as evidence that ceiling vision can provide robust localization information, even in the presence of occlusions. We perform real-world experiments using a robotic vacuum cleaner equipped with an upward-facing camera in two different apartments across multiple trajectories and compare the proposed method with competing approaches. Our solution shows superior localization results using maps where neither furniture or movable objects are not modeled.},

The robots automatically recognize the occurrence of map overlapping by matching their current frame with the maps built by other robots. With the robust data association technique from the ceiling-vision based {SLAM}, the proposed algorithm robustly detects the overlapping regions and estimates the accurate transformations for map alignment.

In an experiment with challenging situations in a real environment, our method was performed impressively in terms of the robustness and accuracy.

	abstract = {A typical indoor environment can be divided into three categories; ofﬁce (or room), hallway, and wide-open space such as lobby and hall. There have been numerous approaches for solving simultaneous localization and mapping ({SLAM}) problem in ofﬁce (or room) and hallway. However, direct application of the existing approaches to wide-open space may be failed, because it has some distinguished features compared to other indoor places. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a new ceiling vision-based active {SLAM} framework, with an emphasis on practical deployment of service robot for commercial use in dynamically changing and wide-open environments by adopting the ceiling vision. First, for deﬁning ceiling feature which can be extracted regardless of complexity of ceiling pattern we introduce a model-free landmark, i.e., visual node descriptor, which consists of edge points and their orientations in image space. Second, a recursive ‘explore and exploit’ is proposed for autonomous mapping. It is recursively performed by spreading out mapped area gradually while the robot is actively localized in the map. It can improve map accuracy due to frequent small loop closing. Third, a dynamic edge link ({DEL}) is proposed to cope with environmental changes in the map. Owing to {DEL}, we do not need to ﬁlter out corrupted sensor data and to distinguish moving object from static one.},

	abstract = {An efficient algorithmic solution to the classical five-point relative pose problem is presented. The problem is to find the possible solutions for relative camera pose between two calibrated views given five corresponding points. The algorithm consists of computing the coefficients of a tenth degree polynomial in closed form and, subsequently, finding its roots. It is the first algorithm well-suited for numerical implementation that also corresponds to the inherent complexity of the problem. We investigate the numerical precision of the algorithm. We also study its performance under noise in minimal as well as overdetermined cases. The performance is compared to that of the well-known 8 and 7-point methods and a 6-point scheme. The algorithm is used in a robust hypothesize-and-test framework to estimate structure and motion in real-time with low delay. The real-time system uses solely visual input and has been demonstrated at major conferences.},

This is due to the need of numerous emerging applications like telepresence and robot navigation. The key issue is to determine a robust estimate of the (3×3) essential matrix with its five degrees of freedom. In this work, a robust technique to compute the essential matrix is suggested under the assumption that the images are calibrated. The algorithm is a combination of the five-point relative pose problem using an optimization technique on a manifold, with the random sample consensus.

	abstract = {We propose a fast and robust {CV}-{SLAM} (ceiling vision-based simultaneous localization and mapping) technique using a single ceiling vision sensor. The proposed algorithm is suitable for system that demands very high localization accuracy such as an intelligent robot vacuum cleaner. A single camera looking upward direction (called ceiling vision system) is mounted on the robot, and salient image features are detected and tracked through the image sequence. Compared with the conventional frontal view systems, the ceiling vision has advantage in tracking, since it involves only rotation and affine transform without scale change. And, in this paper, we solve the rotation and affine transform problems using 3D gradient orientation estimation method and multi-view description of landmarks. By applying these methods to the solution for data association, we can reconstruct the 3D landmark map in real-time through the extend Kalman filter based {SLAM} framework. Furthermore, relocation problem is solved efficiently by using a wide base line matching between the reconstructed 3D map and a 2D ceiling image. Experimental results demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed algorithm in real environments.},

We propose a novel approach to monocular {SLAM} using corner, lamp, and door features simultaneously to achieve stable navigation in various environments. We use the corner features and the circular-shaped brightest parts of the ceiling image for detection of lamp features. Furthermore, vertical and horizontal lines are combined to robustly detect line-based door features to reduce the problem that line features can be easily misidentified due to nearby edges. The use of these three types of features as landmarks increases our ability to observe the features in various environments and maintains the stability of the {SLAM} process.

	abstract = {The simultaneous localization and map building ({SLAM}) problem asks if it is possible for an autonomous vehicle to start in an unknown location in an unknown environment and then to incrementally build a map of this environment while simultaneously using this map to compute absolute vehicle location. Starting from estimation-theoretic foundations of this problem, the paper proves that a solution to the {SLAM} problem is indeed possible. The underlying structure of the {SLAM} problem is first elucidated. A proof that the estimated map converges monotonically to a relative map with zero uncertainty is then developed. It is then shown that the absolute accuracy of the map and the vehicle location reach a lower bound defined only by the initial vehicle uncertainty. Together, these results show that it is possible for an autonomous vehicle to start in an unknown location in an unknown environment and, using relative observations only, incrementally build a perfect map of the world and to compute simultaneously a bounded estimate of vehicle location. The paper also describes a substantial implementation of the {SLAM} algorithm on a vehicle operating in an outdoor environment using millimeter-wave radar to provide relative map observations. This implementation is used to demonstrate how some key issues such as map management and data association can be handled in a practical environment. The results obtained are cross-compared with absolute locations of the map landmarks obtained by surveying. In conclusion, the paper discusses a number of key issues raised by the solution to the {SLAM} problem including suboptimal map-building algorithms and map management.},

The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a a substantial range of afﬁne distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and ﬁnally performing veriﬁcation through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.},

We use a quadratic objective function to formulate calibration as a quadratically constrained quadratic program ({QCQP}). By leveraging recent advances in the optimization of {QCQPs}, we are able to use existing semidefinite program ({SDP}) solvers to obtain a certifiably global optimum via the Lagrangian dual problem. Our problem formulation can be globally optimized by existing general-purpose solvers in less than a second, regardless of the number of measurements available and the noise level. This enables a variety of robotic platforms to rapidly and robustly compute and certify a globally optimal set of calibration parameters without a prior estimate or operator intervention. We compare the performance of our approach with a local solver on extensive simulations and multiple real datasets. Finally, we present necessary observability conditions that connect our approach to recent theoretical results and analytically support the empirical performance of our system.},

While these techniques often work well in practice, they do not provide guarantees on the quality of the estimate. This paper shows that Lagrangian duality is a powerful tool to assess the quality of a given candidate solution. Our contribution is threefold. First, we discuss a revised formulation of the {SLAM} inference problem. We show that this formulation is probabilistically grounded and has the advantage of leading to an optimization problem with quadratic objective. The second contribution is the derivation of the corresponding Lagrangian dual problem. The {SLAM} dual problem is a (convex) semidefinite program, which can be solved reliably and globally by off-the-shelf solvers. The third contribution is to discuss the relation between the original {SLAM} problem and its dual. We show that from the dual problem, one can evaluate the quality (i.e., the suboptimality gap) of a candidate {SLAM} solution, and ultimately provide a certificate of optimality. Moreover, when the duality gap is zero, one can compute a guaranteed optimal {SLAM} solution from the dual problem, circumventing non-convex optimization. We present extensive (real and simulated) experiments supporting our claims and discuss practical relevance and open problems.},

	abstract = {Indoor localization for mobile industrial robots is a crucial step toward an autonomous system. A mobile robot needs a reliable and robust localization system to achieve its task autonomously. A reasonable estimate of the robot's state can be achieved through Visual Odometry ({VO}); however, with dynamic objects in the scene, classical {VO} approaches need to detect and filter these moving objects. Alternatively, we can use an up-facing camera to track the movement with respect to the ceiling, which represents a static and invariant space. This paper presents Ceiling-{DSO}: an indoor ceiling-vision ({CV}) system based on Direct Sparse Odometry ({DSO}). We take advantage of the generic formulation of {DSO} to avoid making assumptions about the observable shapes or landmarks on the ceiling, making the method generic and applicable to multiple ceiling types. We built a ceiling-vision dataset in a real-world scenario; we then used it to test our approach with different {DSO} parameters to identify the best fit for robot pose estimation. This paper provides a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the obtained results that showed an acceptable error rate compared to the ground truth.},

If the robot pose is unknown, the region-based ceiling features from the current image are matched to a pre-built feature map from the {RBPF}-based {SLAM} process. Then, the candidate areas of the real robot pose are set around the matched features. The candidates are represented by two spots for the features having both position and orientation, while by a circle if they have only position. Finally, the real robot pose is determined at the intersection point. The candidate areas are realistically modeled by applying the observation error, and useless candidates are significantly reduced by considering the feature orientation. Several experiments in real environments validated the effectiveness of the proposed global localization scheme.},

	abstract = {This paper deals with monocular {SLAM} of a mobile robot in an indoor environment where visually similar features (so-called indistinguishable features) exist on the ceiling. When these indistinguishable features exist near a feature, data association suffers from false matches which lead to localization failure. To reliably estimate the robot pose in various environments, the proposed scheme uses the additional information on whether the features are easily distinguishable (unique) or not. Then, a ceiling plane is estimated by the heights of the unique features to find the positions of the indistinguishable features approximately. Reliable data association is done by registering the indistinguishable features on the ceiling plane with small uncertainty regions which prevent the false matches. After this preprocess step, the data association results are used within the extended Kalman filter to estimate the robot pose. Corners and lamps are used as features in the experiments, and the results show that the proposed method successfully works in various indoor environments including indistinguishable features.},

In our study, the robots start the single {SLAM} with their own global coordinate, and merge their maps during the operation by detecting the overlapped region of their maps. The robots automatically recognize the occurrence of map overlapping by matching their current frame with the maps built by other robots. With the robust data association technique from the ceiling-vision based {SLAM}, the proposed algorithm robustly detects the overlapping regions and estimates the accurate transformations for map alignment. In our experiment, we have verified that our algorithm successfully enables the multi-robot {SLAM} without any initial correspondence or encounter of robots.},

Particle filters, however, often suffer from particle impoverishment, which is caused by a mismatch between proposal distribution and target distribution. To solve this problem, we propose a new method to improve the efficiency of particle filters by employing the particle swarm optimization ({PSO}), which is a kind of swarm intelligence algorithm. The {PSO}, especially its variant for dynamic models, is combined with the generic particle filter to get samples that are well matched with target distribution. The resulting filter is applied to a vision based {SLAM} system and its performance is tested. We present experimental results that demonstrate improved accuracy in localization and mapping at the same or less computational cost than the conventional particle filters.},

For camera-based localization, landmark or feature based maps tend to be favored in current research. This may be because of a tacit assumption that working with a textured occupancy grid with a camera would be impractical. We demonstrate that a textured occupancy grid can be combined with an extremely simple monocular localization algorithm to produce a viable localization solution. Our approach is simple, efficient, and produces localization results comparable to laser localization results. A consequence of this result is that a single map representation, the textured occupancy grid, can now be used for humans, robots with laser rangefinders, and robots with just a single camera.},

	abstract = {To navigate reliably in indoor environments, a mobile robot must know where it is. This includes both the ability of globally localizing the robot from scratch, as well as tracking the robot's position once its location is known. Vision has long been advertised as providing a solution to these problems, but we still lack efficient solutions in unmodified environments. Many existing approaches require modification of the environment to function properly, and those that work within unmodified environments seldomly address the problem of global localization. In this paper we present a novel, vision-based localization method based on the {CONDENSATION} algorithm, a Bayesian filtering method that uses a sampling-based density representation. We show how the {CONDENSATION} algorithm can be rued in a novel way to track the position of the camera platform rather than tracking an object in the scene. In addition, it can also be used to globally localize the camera platform, given a visual map of the environment. Based on these two observations, we present a vision-based robot localization method that provides a solution to a difficult and open problem in the mobile robotics community. As evidence for the viability of our approach, we show both global localization and tracking results in the context of a state of the art robotics application.},

Mobile robots do not have a successful solution to recover when localization fails due to slippage. Unexpected inputs such as wheel slippage lead to false prediction during the {SLAM} process. In this paper, minimizing the risk of localization failure is proposed by applying optical flow to the ceiling image sequences as a slippage detector. The optical flow-based motion estimation results are applied to the prediction step of {EKF}-{SLAM}. Using optical flow, we can calculate a homogenous 2D affine transformation matrix. From this matrix we can calculate the relative pose between the two frames. The reliable motion estimation from the vision sensor enables slip detection during the prediction phase of {EKF} {SLAM}. The proposed method was successfully verified by several experiments with deliberate slippage in real environments.},

The method resorts to a {PCA}-based positioning sensor, filtered in a Bayesian probabilistic grid and combined with linear Kalman filters to estimate the global pose of mobile robots. In the implemented system, the information of the environment is captured only with onboard sensors installed in a differential drive robot: encoders, compass, and 2D depth sensor pointed to the ceiling. The use of {PCA} in a Bayesian probabilistic grid allows to fuse the highly compressed {PCA} database information, obtained with the low computational effort, in an environment where repetitive scenarios can occur. To avoid the negative impact in the localization estimate caused by the corrupted data existing in the 2D depth sensor, an extension to the classic {PCA} algorithm is suggested. Thus, the proposed method allows the self-localization of mobile robots in indoor environments with bounded accuracy and working in a wide range of illumination conditions.},

Traditionally, {VO}/{VSLAM} methods have used photometric images to estimate camera poses, but they suffer from varying illumination and viewpoint changes. Thus, methods using semantic images have been an alternative to increase consistency, as semantic information has shown its robustness even in hostile environments. Our measure compares semantic classes of map point reprojection pairs between images to improve the camera pose estimation accuracy in {VO}/{VSLAM}. To evaluate the difference between semantic classes, we adopt the normalized information distance ({NID}) from information theory. Furthermore, we suggest a weight parameter to balance the existing error of {VO}/{VSLAM} with the semantic error introduced by our approach. Our experimental results, obtained from the {VKITTI} and {KITTI} benchmark datasets, show that the proposed semantic error measure reduces both the relative pose error ({RPE}) and absolute trajectory error ({ATE}) of camera pose estimation compared to the existing photometric image-based errors of indirect and direct {VO}/{VSLAM}.},

It then grew to implement Simultaneous Localization and Mapping ({SLAM}) on various robots and mobile platforms. As each application brings its own set of contraints on sensors, processing capabilities and locomotion, it raises the question of which {SLAM} approach is the most appropriate to use in terms of cost, accuracy, computation power and ease of integration. Since most of {SLAM} approaches are either visual or lidar-based, comparison is diﬃcult. Therefore, we decided to extend {RTAB}-Map to support both visual and lidar {SLAM}, providing in one package a tool allowing users to implement and compare a variety of 3D and 2D solutions for a wide range of applications with diﬀerent robots and sensors. This paper presents this extended version of {RTAB}-Map and its use in comparing, both quantitatively and qualitatively, a large selection of popular real-world datasets (e.g., {KITTI}, {EuRoC}, {TUM} {RGB}-D, {MIT} Stata Center on {PR}2 robot), outlining strengths and limitations of visual and lidar {SLAM} conﬁgurations from a practical perspective for autonomous navigation applications.},

The estimated motion from inertial measurement unit ({IMU}) pre-integration de-skews point clouds and produces an initial guess for lidar odometry optimization. The obtained lidar odometry solution is used to estimate the bias of the {IMU}. To ensure high performance in real-time, we marginalize old lidar scans for pose optimization, rather than matching lidar scans to a global map. Scan-matching at a local scale instead of a global scale significantly improves the real-time performance of the system, as does the selective introduction of keyframes, and an efficient sliding window approach that registers a new keyframe to a fixed-size set of prior ``sub-keyframes.'' The proposed method is extensively evaluated on datasets gathered from three platforms over various scales and environments.},

Such a factorization can be visualized with a bipartite graph that we call a factor graph, In this tutorial paper, we present a generic message-passing algorithm, the sum-product algorithm, that operates in a factor graph. Following a single, simple computational rule, the sum-product algorithm computes-either exactly or approximately-various marginal functions derived from the global function. A wide variety of algorithms developed in artificial intelligence, signal processing, and digital communications can be derived as specific instances of the sum-product algorithm, including the forward/backward algorithm, the Viterbi algorithm, the iterative "turbo" decoding algorithm, Pearl's (1988) belief propagation algorithm for Bayesian networks, the Kalman filter, and certain fast Fourier transform ({FFT}) algorithms.},

	abstract = {Current state of the art scan registration algorithms which use only position information often fall victim to correspondence ambiguity and degeneracy in the optimization solutions. Other methods which use additional channels, such as color or intensity, often use only a small fraction of the available information and ignore the underlying structural information of the added channels. The proposed method incorporates the additional channels directly into the scan registration formulation to provide information within the plane of the surface. This is achieved by calculating the uncertainty both along and perpendicular to the local surface at each point and calculating nearest neighbor correspondences in the higher dimensional space. The proposed method reduces instances of degenerate transformation estimates and improves both registration accuracy and convergence rate. The method is tested on the Ford Vision and Lidar dataset using both color and intensity channels, as well as with Microsoft Kinect data from the Freiburg {RGBD} Office dataset and data obtained from the University of Waterloo campus.},

	abstract = {{SLAM} can be viewed as an estimation problem over graphs. It is well known that the topology of each dataset affects the quality of the corresponding optimal estimate. In this paper we present a formal analysis of the impact of graph structure on the reliability of the maximum likelihood estimator. In particular, we show that the number of spanning trees in the graph is closely related to the D-optimality criterion in experimental design. We also reveal that in a special class of linear-Gaussian estimation problems over graphs, the algebraic connectivity is related to the E-optimality design criterion. Furthermore, we explain how the average node degree of the graph is related to the ratio between the minimum of negative log-likelihood achievable and its value at the ground truth. These novel insights give us a deeper understanding of the {SLAM} problem. Finally we discuss two important applications of our analysis in active measurement selection and graph pruning. The results obtained from simulations and experiments on real data conﬁrm our theoretical ﬁndings.},
